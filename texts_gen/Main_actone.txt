Event: d1

You have come dangerously close to the dreaded hive of the No-Tails. Few goodbeasts dwell here besides the races the Tailless have enslaved, or those too small for them to notice.

Hollow structures built from the remains of murdered Trees stand here and there, most stinking of the Tailless' oily Other-smell.

One of these edifices, however, is almost devoid of the No-Tails' scent. Instead, the air here is redolent with the sweet smell of rot, of Earth slowly reclaiming things left behind.

Cautiously entering the dilapidated Den, you discover that it is home to an enclave of lesser Slideclaws.

They laze about on bundles of dead, rotting Grass, many of them asleep, though a few are awake and washing themselves, combing their fur with their rough tongues.

/MasteryDisplay

A sable-furred, golden-eyed Slideclaw Birther, heavy with young, seems to preside over this half-conscious gathering. When you prod at her Mind with your Song, she responds, her reply full of slow loops and curls.

<cat_queen>A Draak kitten. How amusing,</cat_queen> she drawls, her tail tracing languid symbols in the Air. <cat_queen>This is a Dream-Den of the Slideclaw People. Leave this place, before the No-Tails follow you here and disturb our dreams with your loud and tedious Destruction.

What will you do?

==============================
Event: d10

You are exploring the warmward part of the valley, staying near to the stream (this Sun is particularly bold) when you hear a prolonged splashing sound.

It is too irregular to be water running over rocks and too long-lasting to be a predator struggling with prey, and as you approach, the oily, Otherish stench of the Tailless fills the air.

These are smaller than the No-Tails which you saw before, their scents cleaner and newer but still disturbing. They may be hatchlings of their kind.

Two are play-fighting as young furbeasts sometimes do, honing their battle skills, while two more watch, emitting a whooping, barking song. A fifth sits alone on the bank, doing something strange with its forepaw.

What do you do?

------------------------------
> Attempt to communicate.
  Go to: d10a

> One of the play-fighting ones.
  Go to: d10aa
> One of the ones observing the play-fight.
  Go to: d10ab
> The one alone on the bank nearest you.
  Go to: d10ac

==============================
Event: d10aa

The Minds of the play-fighting ones are very focused on each other and whirling with strong emotions. When you finally do manage to project a simple image into one's Mind, it does nothing but briefly distract it, which the other uses to make it fall and lose.

The others make chattering ha-ha-ha sounds at it, and it begins to lash out in rage at its fellows.

Soon the play-fighting has become earnest fighting, and two of them are beating the very red Essence out of each other's muzzles. Dangerous-looking adults soon arrive to interfere, and you use the distraction to remove yourself from the area.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d10ab

The attempt to sing into the hatchling's Mind is difficult - its thoughts and even its emotions are all tinged with a strangeness which makes it a difficult plane for you to inscribe images upon - and when it finally realizes it is being sung to, it begins waving its forepaws at its fellows and chattering agitatedly while attempting to shut you out of its Mind.

Soon, it has enlisted its fellows in a search for you... apparently, it could feel what direction your Mind-song was coming from... and the five hatchlings are swiftly closing in on your location.

Five at once is obviously too many, especially not knowing what strange powers these Others may have, and you make a hasty escape.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d10ac

Singing into its Mind is harder than you expected... the sheer oddity of its thoughts and emotions make it like trying to smell a stone underwater. Eventually, however, you feel some kind of connection, and paint a universal sigil for it to receive.

Slowly, the hatchling looks up, and then directly at you - it seems to be able to sense where you are from the communication. You expect it to panic or cry for help, but to your surprise, it does not, instead forming a strange sigil of its own inside the connection. You smell a little fear, but it still seems in control of itself.

After some trial and error, you trade a few ideas. It does not seem to be able to communicate fluidly like a Draak, or even a regular Goodbeast, failing to intuit the meaning of many of your sigils, which you believed were written upon every Mind.

When it does respond, what it does communicate is lavish - it shows you a sunrise so rife with detail that you can almost see it yourself and a lightning-storm witnessed from inside a small cave.

Most oddly, at one point, it shows you what looks like No-Tails harming each other, an image of particular importance in its Mind, but you do not understand its significance.

Maintaining the communication is deeply tiring for you... the No-Tail Mind is full of sharp needles of hardened information and quagmires of half-dealt-with fears.

Eventually, several adults come to collect the hatchlings, and you were so distracted by the communication that you have now been surrounded.

Just when you are to be discovered, though, the hatchling with whom you communicated barks at the adult about to stumble upon you, distracting it and leading it away. The hatchling has also left some shiny rocks it wore around its neck behind.

Soon, the No-Tails are gone and you are safe. This day seems to have bred more questions than answers... why did the No-Tail hatchling lead the adults away from you? It must have known you were dangerous, and would only become more so in time. The Mind you saw during your communication was deeply Other, and very difficult for you to connect with, and yet there was a glimmer of something beneath the overcomplicated morass.

Something like a bright stone hidden in a dark treetop at night, or a single lump of gold in the midst of a swamp. Like something good, something valuable, hidden in the most unlikely of places.

Perhaps the lone Tailless was simply unlike others of its kind, or perhaps a long, long journey of understanding was begun this Sun. Time will tell.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d10b

The lone one is clearly the most vulnerable, and you leap upon it, jaws wide, from cover while the four in midstream are particularly distracted. You close your teeth upon its slick, scaleless hide, viciously tearing at it with your claws.

The hatchling makes squealing sounds, but by the time its fellows notice, the sand is already red with its Essence. You think for a moment that they may try to fight you or launch things at you with their No-Tail magic, but instead, they panic and flee.

By the time they return with adults, you have torn the lone hatchling's life from its Body and consumed much of its flesh, taking it into yourself. It is a large and oddly satisfying meal... in fact, its oily flavor was downright delicious.

You leave what is left behind as the others approach, but you have a full belly and feel strangely joyful. There seems to be a kind of deep satisfaction to be had in the Destruction of these bizarre invaders of your ancestral lands. The hatchling also wore a string of shiny stones around its neck, which you keep as a souvenir.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d10c

The Tailless hatchlings are more bizarre than you imagined. The four in midstream take turns battling each other... it seems that whoever makes the other one fall is the victor. Up on just two thin legs, it is a wonder they are not constantly falling anyway.

They continue to make sounds, some of which are picked up and repeated by others. The particular sound of one of their squeals or whines can cause very specific reactions in others, and you would guess that they are somehow communicating with a complex code of sounds. They seem to hate cool, clear Silence, constantly communicating when there is no clear need for it.

Even after a good while, they do not seem to smell you nearby... are they nose-blind?

The one not participating in the fighting seems to be creating a very complex pattern in the sand with its foreclaw, accenting it with small stones.

You try for a long time to discern what purpose this might have, but in the end are forced to give up... the sand-pattern doesn't seem to be doing anything at all, nor would such things have any application in natural life which you could imagine. Perhaps this one has a damaged Mind.

You are just beginning to learn a few of their basic gestures and sounds when a group of adults arrive from downwind, avoiding your senses until it is too late; you are now surrounded.

The hatchlings chatter at the adults, who seem to want them to stop play-fighting and follow them, but the hatchlings are daring to disobey, seemingly purely for the sake of fun, behavior which would be suicidal in any other species. A few are wandering close to where you are hiding.

What do you do?

------------------------------
> Stay perfectly still.

> Use your fiery breath to create a diversion.

==============================
Event: d10caf

You attempt to remain still, but your Mind is whirling with fear and trepidation. When the wind blows your scent in their direction, you panic, certain that you will be scented, and break from cover.

The No-Tails somehow launch small stones at high velocity from their forepaws at you, but you barely feel the pain as you flee in terror.

The injuries were not too terrible, but now they know that you were here. You take pains to make it difficult for them to track you back to your den, but you cannot be sure that your blunder will not have consequences. You are, however, now aware of why you failed, and will be better at such things in the future.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d10cas

You quiet both your Body and your Mind and become like a stone.

At one point, the wind blows your scent right to the Tailless, and you fear discovery, but somehow, they sense nothing - they must truly have no sense of smell, or almost none.

Though a few of them come near you, your total lack of motion and the shade of the bush you are hiding in do nothing to betray your presence, and the No-tail hatchlings eventually accompany the adults away, stumbling back towards their Hive on their stiltlike legs.

You have learned more about the No-Tails, and lived to perhaps one day put that knowledge to use.

==============================
Event: d10cbf

You burst out of the foliage, trailing tiny leaves behind you as you make for the safety of the woods. Unfortunately, you are not quite fast enough to avoid catching a few projectiles which they somehow launch from their forepaws.

The injuries were not too terrible, but now they know that you were here. You take pains to make it difficult for them to track you back to your Den, but you cannot be sure that your blunder will not have consequences.

In the future, you will be a little bit faster, having learned from your failure.

==============================
Event: d10cbs

You burst out of the foliage, trailing tiny leaves behind you as you make for the safety of the woods.

So swift and sudden is your dash that the No-Tails have no time to attack you, although they bark and growl to each other loudly, pointing their foreclaws at you.

You are safely away before long, and take pains to make it difficult for them to track you back to your Den, but you cannot be sure that this will not have consequences.

==============================
Event: d10ccf

You belch up the fireseed from your belly and breathe it out onto a nearby shrub.

Your breath, however, is not fierce enough to make the rain-watered plants catch fire. It is, however, bright enough to catch the No-Tails' attention, and soon you are running away as fast as you can as the Tailless somehow launch projectiles at you from their forepaws.

The injuries were not too terrible, but now they know that you were here. You take pains to make it difficult for them to track you back to your den, but you cannot be sure that your blunder will not have consequences.

You will, however, be better at focusing your fire-breath in the future.

You are safely away before long, and do not believe that you were seen. Still, you take a long route back to your Den, in case you are being followed.

It is known that the No-Tails have ways of attacking without even being near you, and where hatchlings are, adults may be near.

As soon as you reveal yourself, you are spotted by one of the Tailless workers, and they begin singing shrilly and launching hard things at you with their forepaws. A No-Tail carrying a fang on the end of a stick and protected by shinestone-studded coverings intercepts you, clearly meaning to Destroy you.

Incredibly, you manage to Silence the Warrior No-Tail, ending its fell existence. The others break away in fear, throwing anything they can at you as they scramble, stumbling on their two legs as quickly as they can.

No-Tails such as this one destroyed a grown Kin on your first day of life. You are not stupid enough to take one on while still so small and inexperienced, and flee, living to see another Sun.

Event: d11base

The No-Tails are Destroying a hill. Like ants, they are carrying its vast corpse away one piece at a time to their Hive, perhaps to be eaten, though you know of no other animal which eats the very flesh of the Great Mother.

Most interestingly, they have unearthed something very strange in the process.

It seems to be some sort of large claw or fang, but its Essence is entirely alien - simply being near it makes your teeth rattle and your bones quake within you.

The No-Tails have summoned an authority among their kind to determine how to proceed.

Event: d11bf

Alas, the Flame Within is not yet powerful enough to create a true conflagration, and simply makes some smoking, withered vegetation.

This is not enough to fully distract them into leaving the artifact unguarded, but it does alert them to your presence, and you are forced to flee, as there are too many of them to fight.

You did, however, get some practice at focusing your flames, and will be better at it in the future.

Your powerful flaming breath soon sets the back of the gutted hillside alight, and the No-Tails scramble to investigate.

Event: d11c

The Great Grazer placidly waiting nearby has a simple Mind, but with patience, you manage to get it to trade thoughts with you.

It informs you that the No-Tails do not, in fact, eat the Great Mother's flesh which they pull from the hill, but fashion various things out of it whose purpose the Grazer does not know.

It does, however, remember feeling this teeth-rattling Essence before, when it accompanied its masters to meet what it calls the <color #f9d7f7>Diggers.</color> They seem to be some kind of Other being, Tailless and yet not quite the same as the Tailless you know, who live far away from Sun and fashion great things out of shinestone and jewels.

Whatever this thing is that they've found, it may have been lost by the "Diggers", and may be something of importance to them.

At that point, the Great Grazer's thoughts and opinions begin to have more and more to do with Grass... it must be getting hungry... and you stop communicating with it after a few questions in a row are answered with nothing more than <ox_boi>GRASS... YUMMY GRASS.

The vibrations which shake you to your Core emanating from the thing they have found cannot possibly be anything good. Any action you take will expose you to the inscrutable and Law-defying wrath of the Tailless.

You flatten yourself to the ground and slowly creep closer. You make certain to approach from downwind, and make almost no sound.

Unfortunately, it turns out that the Tailless have excellent vision. They see you clearly, even when fairly far away, and soon they are launching various hard things at you. Most now ignore the Fire, focusing instead on your Destruction.

Keeping to the green parts of the hill for camouflage, you move from cover to cover until you are only two Body-lengths away from the artifact. You curl up, coiling your spine like a spring, waiting for the perfect moment.

When the Warrior turns its head at a barked call from another Tailless, you silently grasp the artifact and carry it away, unseen by any of the bipedal menaces.

Event: d12

You have come to a sacred place.

Any goodbeast could sense it; a verdant gateway, redolent with laurel, mint and sweet decay. A being more powerful than even the Kin has claimed this place, and what lies beyond.

This is the entrance to the <color #1ff461><bold>Great Green.</color></bold>

The <bold>Great Green:</bold> the forest primeval where your People have hunted since the first Kin emerged from its Chamber. It is infinite in its beauty and its danger, changing as the Turnings pass.

Though its denizens of long ago are mostly gone, the <bold><color #1ff461>Spirit of the Great Green</color> </bold>remains, forever in its perfect state of constant transformation.

This is the end of Heartbone Valley, where great Darktooth lays claim to the land and the No-Tails build their inscrutable objects. No Tailless has sullied this place beyond with its Otherish presence.

Once you cross this threshhold and take it for your own, it shall be your true home, your domain, and you may never return to Heartbone Valley unless it be by Darktooth's permission, or to challenge him, a feat of which you will surely be incapable for centuries.

The Trees sway gently, and in them you can almost see hidden shapes, visions of what may be, how you might build your life in the wild. Has the time come at last?

Will you gather up your treasures and leave Heartbone Valley behind to begin the next verse in the Song of your Life?

You return to your den and swallow up your treasures. You know that they are mere trinkets compared to the wonders that await discovery in your true home-to-be, but they represent the trials, the precious failures and successes from which you first learned, and you will regurgitate them when you have found your Lair within the Great Green.

Pausing, you take one last look at the tiny Den, already too small, which was your first home outside the Chamber.

It will become a haven for other Goodbeasts, and you begrudge them not; you have made up your Mind, and this land is no longer your home.

A coppery mass lunges at you from behind a nearby Tree; you narrowly avoid being hit by a raking talon.

Your attacker is a true Kin, and a hatchling, as you are. From its scent, it is obviously fruit of the same Creator.

One of its rear legs is warped, withered and inward-turned by some cruel trick of the Onesong. You decide to call this young Kin Twist.

It draws itself into as much of the traditional posture of challenge as it can and hisses at you.

<twist>Begone, Or Feel My Wrath.</twist>

Apparently, Twist has claimed the Great Green, and quite recently at that. It has not properly scent-marked the border, nor does its Essence yet creep through the soil or sing through the wind, as it does when the land recognizes a new monarch.

With your Song, with your Mind, you weave facts into suggestive poetry. A proper riddle must be fair and answerable, but indirect enough to outwit the opponent.

Twist manages to answer your opening riddle with great difficulty, and then asks one of its own. This will continue, you know, until one of you is unable to respond correctly.

You seem to be gaining the upper hand. Twist is, unsurprisingly, nowhere near as clever or wise as great Darktooth.

Finally, it poses this:

You sing a gentle song, expressing your sympathy with Twist's deep misfortune.

You bring up the question of whether it would be fair for a healthy and perfect Kin such as yourself to take away the land of one such as Twist, who can never be truly healthy and whole.

Encouragingly, you praise Twist for surviving this long and hope that it will continue to do so, despite its obvious defect.

As you sing, Twist's crest-feathers rise, and even its chest puffs outward. Its tail lashes back and forth in fury.

Event: d13g

You know of no other territory which is near and unguarded.

Such is the way of the Kin; Earth's bounty may only be claimed by the strong in an ancient and righteous reality.

It is such sharp truths and the overcoming of them which has forged the Kin through the eons into the perfect forms which they... which you... now wear.

Furthermore, both Darktooth, wise elder of the Kin, and your own soul, your deepest-self, have declared that it is your destiny to rule this setward Green.

You can no longer stay in Heartbone Valley, and without a land from which to harvest bright flesh and gleaming Treasure, you will almost certainly perish.

This is your choice: fight for what must be yours in the Way of your People... a good and just Way which builds strength and ensures that the Kin, Lords of Earth, are worthy of their domains...

Or give up your destiny and be Destroyed, knowing that you were unable to face the grim Truths of this world and of the Way of your People.

Do you truly wish to abandon the Great Green and the adventure of this Life for the sake of Fear or Pity?

You are victorious.

Your superiority proven, Twist is forced to slither away in search of a new home. With so little land unclaimed in this world and weighed down by both youth and deformity, its chances are slim.

But such is the Way, the Good Way of the Draak-Kin. The strong survive, and the weak perish.

Nothing now stands in your way. It is time to cross the threshold.

With Essence ablaze, you enter this realm, this place of magic, this setting for the grand adventure which will be your life.

The Great Green shall belong to you, and you shall belong to it; so it is Sung by the Music in your heart.

Bobbing your head, you belch the fireseed up from your Core and breathe it out on the yellowed Grass-corpses.

The Slideclaws are suddenly attentive and wide-eyed, quickly escaping through various narrow exits.

The queen, her tail lashing back and forth in annoyance, looks down at you coldly as the flames grow. <cat_queen>We are NOT amused,</cat_queen> she sings, and leaps away to safety.

The dead trees of which this place is composed have now caught the flame, and over the crackles and the building roar, you feel the one-two stomp of approaching No-Tails in the ground... many of them. You make your escape before they arrive, satisfied that you have proven your superiority to the arrogant Slideclaws.

Your attempts at further communication are met with disdainful yawns and tail-flicks.

<cat_queen>We find little amusement in trading thoughts with a Draak, much less a mere kitten of their fading kind. If you desire the immense privilege of conversation with the Slideclaws, the Perfect People, then you must bring us a token of your esteem.

==============================
Event: d1bb

There is a long silence - you are unsure about whether the dark Birther is thinking or simply making you wait.

Just as you are starting to become certain that it is the latter, she replies, her Mind-song shapely and unhurried:

<cat_queen>The Sacred Joy-Plant - an offering of this may make you worthy of our attention. You can smell it on that one's breath.</cat_queen>

A clearly inebriated Slideclaw Giver rolling about on the dead grass and making a rumbling sound deep within its Body does indeed reek of a strange herbal scent.

<cat_queen>Or perhaps an offering of flesh? Bring us the Quiet Body of one of the Suncallers whom the No-Tails keep as slaves to announce the dawn. We have smelled their flesh as it is roasted by the Tailless - it is savory-sweet.

Event: d1bba

It takes the better part of two Suns to do it, but you find a small patch of the Sacred Joy-Plant of the Slideclaws growing in the Green setwards from the great River.

Its scent is unique, though it doesn't send you out of your Mind, as it seems to do to the Slideclaws.

When you return with it, the presiding Slideclaw asks you to give it over.

------------------------------
> Follow her command.
  Go to: d1bbaa
> Refuse to hand it over until she grants you what you seek.
  Go to: d1bbab

==============================
Event: d1bbaa

The Slideclaw leader nibbles it, rolls in it, and inhales its scent deeply.

It is unclear why, but her Essence seems to burn brighter, though her Mind is clearly affected. Her song begins to devolve into semi-random images, punctuated by giggling squiggles and memories of past Dances painted in sun-bright colors.

You attempt to hold the Slideclaw to her bargain and begin a conversation, but it soon becomes clear that she is in no state to reply, nor will others of her kind deign to communicate with you.

You drop the Joy-Plant from your mouth onto the ground and proceed to lie on it, sending a clear message. The Slideclaw yawns, stretches, and sits up.

Event: d1bbb

Destroying the Suncaller was not too challenging, but you had to quickly retreat with its Body in your maw... the No-Tails seem to have been alerted by the noise. They may now search for you more actively.

The Slideclaws descend upon the lifeless Body when you present it to them. They toy with it, tear off its feathers and play with them, and consume the flesh of its breast unhurriedly. When they can glean no more amusement nor nutrition from it, the Birther-leader turns her attention back to you. <cat_queen>Sing, and we shall reply.

<cat_queen>The Night itself is our territory, and we acknowledge no boundary.

<cat_queen>We proudly sing out during our Dances of Creation, safe in the knowledge that few indeed would dare attack us. This world holds so little challenge for us that we must walk in the Dreaming to find new amusements and tests of our cleverness and wit.

The Birther is disgusted by the very idea.

<cat_queen>The Perfect People, slaves of the Tailless? The Draak are more slow-witted than we believed. Ours is the perfect deception... they think themselves our masters, but it is we who have mastered them.

<cat_queen>They stroke our Bodies, trailing long fingers down our spine and bringing pleasure; their produce attracts small furbeasts for us to Destroy at our leisure; they provide soft places for us to lie and enter the Dreaming, safe from all foes.

<cat_queen>They are our armor, keeping even the Draak away, and letting us live in blessed sloth and lazy plenty. In exchange, we give nothing but the privilege of our presence.

<cat_queen>Though ten thousand Turnings pass, the Tailless will never make slaves of us, for we fear no strife, and will never trade our freedom for security, as the stonefooted ones and the barking, drooling lackey-beasts whom we refuse to name have done.

<cat_queen>In these places, the Perfect People gather to share tales of what has transpired in the Dreaming, the land hidden within the darkness of sleep.

<cat_queen>Every kitten is taught the fine art of entering the Dreaming with Mind awake - instead of being carried on the tides of sleep, we take control of our dreams, forging bright paths and hunting never-born prey, drinking in sights, sounds and smells which never were in this world and never shall be, engaging in Dances of Creation with mates of indescribable beauty, and these are but the least of the wonders of the worlds within our Minds.

<cat_queen>Such amusement!

Event: d1cd

The Slideclaw queen thumps her tail against her throne of dead Grass mirthfully.

<cat_queen>It amuses us greatly that one of the mighty Kin would ask a Lesser Slideclaw for instruction! Often have we heard of the scaled and feathered pride of your People.

<cat_queen>It would give us immense pleasure to have a Draak bow down before us, and beg for our help. Do so, and we shall instruct you.

A few of the Slideclaws tense their bodies subtly, flicking an ear or glancing at possible exits, as though concerned that their leader has perhaps gone too far in demanding the direct submission of a True Kin to another Goodbeast.

------------------------------
> Refuse, and leave.

==============================
Event: d1cda

Your sense of self might never recover from bowing down before a small furbeast and begging it to teach you its ways. If any other Draak heard of it, the shame would follow you throughout your life, and you may never be chosen for the Dance of Creation.

You remove yourself from the insufferable creature with your sacred Pride intact.

Event: d1cdb

An ancient rage boils within you as you hear the impertinent furbeast demand that you bow down to her. Your people have been the greatest of the Children of Heaven and Earth since long before her kind even knew life. She is now openly mocking everything you are.

Bobbing your head, you belch the fireseed up from your Core and breathe it out on the yellowed Grass-corpses. The Slideclaws are suddenly attentive and wide-eyed, quickly escaping through various narrow exits.

The queen, her tail lashing back and forth in annoyance, looks down at you coldly as the flames grow.

<cat_queen>We are NOT amused,</cat_queen> she sings, and leaps away to safety.

The dead trees of which this place is composed have now caught the flame, and over the crackles and the building roar, you feel the one-two stomp of approaching No-Tails in the ground... many of them.

Event: d1cdc

The other Slideclaws are nothing short of shocked by this display, but their leader accepts your self-abasement with relish.

<cat_queen>Delicious!</cat_queen> she yawns, stretching her kitten-swollen frame long on her throne. <cat_queen>Forever shall the Slideclaws sing of the day a mighty Draak humbled itself before us, and acknowledged the greatness of the Perfect People! Listen, and I shall teach...

The queen gives you complete and precise instruction. To enter the Dreaming, the Body must sleep with the Mind still awake. The training for this requires certain exercises to develop one's own consciousness and sense of awareness, so that one becomes aware that one is dreaming, and not merely a pawn caught up in the flow of the visions.

When one can consistently know dream from reality in every moment, even sleeping, and when the realization does not cause awakening (and she teaches you a technique to prevent that) then the dream will fall under one's own control. Using this method, fantastic visions may come.

At last, you feel as though you have absorbed every detail, and are now ready to attempt it on your own; by spending a day sleeping in your Lair, you can now bathe yourself in lavish experiences which may inspire you to temporary power.

As you withdraw, you hear one of the Slideclaws ask the leader whether it was wise to share such a secret with a Draak. <cat_queen>For the price this one has paid, the exchange was meager,</cat_queen> she replies smugly.

<cat_queen>This day, a Draak has given over its very Pride to the Slideclaws.

Almost casually, as you go, you belch the fireseed up from your Core and breathe it out on the yellowed Grass-corpses.

The Slideclaws are suddenly fearful and wide-eyed, quickly escaping through various narrow exits. The queen, her tail lashing back and forth in annoyance, looks down at you coldly as the flames grow.

Event: d2

Crawling outside your den in the cool of the evening to relieve yourself, you bear witness to a thousand diminutive miracles.

They are a kind of Tiny Being, one of the many little armored tribes who live in the undergrowth beneath the notice of mightier Beasts such as yourself, but these are special.

They light up the closing dusk with a beautiful light beaming from their very bodies. Their spirits burn with such fervor that you can see their glowing souls even with your eyes.

Holding themselves in midair as steadily as they can, each beams forth its own radiance in a verdant symphony. Alone, each is a wonder, but together, their Grand Dance of Light sings forth a great Music, just on the edge of perception:

<fireflies>We are the Light which shines in the darkness:
We are the Moon, and Sun, and Stars.

<fireflies>We have found the Light within us
And share it with all, without shame, without thought.

<fireflies>We are the First Guides of those who are lost:
Seek the Light Within You,
The Hidden Sun, and follow, follow.

<fireflies>Dance, Shine, to drive back the Darkness,
Follow the Light which shall bring the Dawn.

<fireflies>We are the messengers of the Great Above
Come to remind you of your True Self:

<fireflies>You are the Light, a Spark passed on by those who came before,
That Nothingness should be made a lie,

<fireflies>That the Truth be forever translated
Into new and wondrous languages of flesh.

One of the living flames drifts near you, blinking questioningly.

How do you react?

------------------------------
> Ignore it.

You easily snap up the tiny thing, but quickly come to regret it; it seems that whatever magic allows them to shine their light also makes them taste extremely bitter.

Your inner Fire bursts outwards briefly, dwarfing their green flickers. For several moments afterward, it seems to you that their dances and lights intensify!

Perhaps it does not matter. Then again, perhaps it does.

Event: d2d

It is not difficult for you to capture a few of them; they hardly attempt to escape, lost within their own Music.

For one night, your den is lit by their display, as though you play host to the stars themselves in your small space.

In the morning, you awaken to find each and every one of them cold and Silent, their lights forever dimmed.

It seems that their lives are brief indeed. Perhaps, in some way, that is part of their message.

==============================
Event: d2e

You attempt to Sing your response, but whether you use your voice or your Mind, the Tiny Beings do not react.

Eventually, you discover that individually, their Minds are just too simple, incapable of forming distinct images.

It is only as a collective that they form an eloquent Music, as if each of them were only a tiny fragment of the greater whole whose song is so beautiful and bright.

Eventually, you give up attempts to communicate; they are altogether a Song, existing not to hear, but only to be heard.

Your promise to seek the Light Within must remain a secret one, shared only with yourself. Time, and your actions, will determine whether that momentary oath to one day discover your True Self will be kept...

...whether you will become the One to discover and open the<color #d040ff> </color>Door.

Night creeps in, and you think you may have fallen asleep; you saw something like a pattern in the stars above, a counterpoint to the earthly display of the little glowing things wreathed in the treetops.

Where the Heartbone Valley creeks meet, they form a River. The waterway looms deeper here, and among the grey-green shadows you see the forms of Waterbound prey.

This is a realm which you have not yet experienced, but it seems to call to you. Taking a deep breath, you slide under the Water.

Water, it seems, caresses your Body more boldly than Air, and you enjoy the sensation rushing over your feathers and scales, hunger slipping from your Mind.

You are fascinated by the Watery Essence of the scaly swimmers you meet, although they swim away from you quickly, humbly.

Just as you are beginning to master moving in this new landscape, you suddenly stop short. There is... something in the water before you.

To other beings, it might seem no more than a shimmer, but your Draak eyes, open to heat and Essence as well as light, it is far more.

Your Core writhes briefly, excitedly, as you realize you have encountered a Water-spirit, a pure avatar of the sacred element. Its Mind-song prods gently at you, and you open yourself to it... no Draak would be so rude as to deny a messenger of one of the Great Four at least an audience.

<water_spirit>O new-begun hatchling of Sun and Earth,
Hear now my testing Song.

<water_spirit>I ran down a sunlit slope,
Singing gently as I went.

One can dance around all things
As one finds the Flow of the World,
And obstacles become adventures!

The Water-spirit loops about itself in an expression of joy, dispersing its Essence slowly outward until it has become the whole waterway once again. You need to breathe, so you rise to the surface, but before you do, you manage to catch a Rainscale, a savory Waterbound scalebeast, in your jaws.

You spend most of another Sun acclimating yourself further to the domain of Water. While you cannot endure there without drinking in Air from above, you have time aplenty to comfortably explore and even rest in its embrace for short periods.

Just as you begin to wonder if you will see the Water-spirit again, it appears (in its way) and sings to you:

<water_spirit>O new-begun hatchling of Sun and Earth,
Hear now my testing Song.

<water_spirit>Once there was a mighty Draak,
One who hated me, who cursed me,
Who sought my Destruction.

Water tumbles from the sky this Sun, but while walking above may be irksome, small patterings striking your scales randomly, you find that the rain cannot follow you underwater; indeed, in the deep of the river, all is smooth and calm.

It is a <bold>Lumberkin</bold>, one of a People renowned for tenacity and ferocity even in the face of much larger foes. It calls out to you with a strange Song:

<valhalla_badger>Far from frostward fields fares this flame-souled furbeast,
A warrior, though age-weak, and winner of wars.

<valhalla_badger>The wind wafts forth waves of Draak-Kin scent wayward,
A final fight foretelling, Fame and Fortune finding.

<valhalla_badger>To a true fighting soul, Treasures two I shall tender.

It fought savagely to the end. You honestly had no idea that an aged Lumberkin could be such a skilled warrior.

As its last breath rattles forth, it turns its bloodied eye upon you with a look of what could only be called true happiness. The Lumberkin are either completely mad or wholly glorious. Perhaps they are both.

Digging in its nearby den, you unearth something interesting. It is a stone the dark color of freshly-spilled blood. Despite a thorough search, you find nothing else... could it have been lying about the presence of two treasures here?

That night, you have a strange dream: many furbeasts, their Bodies made of stars, are looking down on you from the vaulted dome of the sky. One, whose eyes burn with a holy fire, sings to you before it fades:

<valhalla_badger>Well done, young warrior;
Bear now my blessing!

<valhalla_badger>Freed from my form, I fly to my fate,
Embraced by the bold bygone
Warriors of the Onesong,
My spirit knows solace;

==============================
Event: d5b

You begin to catch shards of their conversation:

<heron>...and so we must proceed with the assumption that all things can be understood, given time and observation. The core elements of reality... Earth, Air, Water, Fire... are predictable and finite, and all things proceed from their motion. It cannot be denied that there is such a thing as expert knowledge, and that such knowledge has both value and merit. Thus it is that the wisest of beings gather <bold>information</bold>.

<heron>Disagreement,</heron> says another, slanting its head slightly to the left.

<heron>The true nature of objects is clearly unknowable. The desires of the observer, as well as the limitations of its senses, ensure that no matter how much information is collected, the true nature of external creatures, or even objects, remains forever out of reach.</heron>

<heron>The wisest observer attempts to understand themselves, and by having a greater control over their own cognition can get closer to the truth than those who remain ignorant of their own psychology. The mark of wisdom is not information, but <bold>self-knowledge</bold>.

<heron>Both of you,</heron> says the third, dipping its bill briefly into the water, <heron>are making the same mistake - you are assuming that objects have a "true nature" to begin with! The Onesong is empty of all meaning and even substance.

<heron>It is not that Truth is hidden by the senses, but that it never existed to begin with. It is but a vain hope of limited beings. A wise being does not seek to accumulate a wealth of information, nor even to understand themselves, for none of these things can be said to matter, or even exist.

<heron>The Onesong is empty, and a truly wise being knows only one thing: that they know nothing, and abandoning all need for understanding, <bold>simply lives</bold>, free from all judgment.

/MasteryDisplay

<heron>The wisdom of the Draak is renowned. Let us ask the one hiding ineffectually nearby,</heron> one suggests, and with subtle motions of their heads, they turn their eyes and ears to you.

<heron>What is the nature of Wisdom? Is it based upon <bold>information</bold>? <bold>Self-knowledge</bold>? Or upon abandoning these things and simply <bold>living</bold>?

------------------------------
> Wisdom is rooted in the gaining of knowledge.
  Go to: d5ba

==============================
Event: d5ba

You respond that the Wise are called so because they have accumulated a vast trove of knowledge; their conclusions are more sound than those who do not know the details of the subject at hand.

By the gathering of information about the vast Onesong, one can begin to perceive the deeper patterns which unite all things. Without those observations, those experiences with the world, the Truth which underlies all cannot be known.

The second and third Spearbills seem unconvinced, but the first appreciates your answer, ruffling its feathers in excitement.

<heron>Agreement! O hatchling of the Draak, may the blessing of Air, realm of the Mind, be upon you!</heron>

As one, they launch into the sky, continuing their argument as they journey onward.

==============================
Event: d5bb

You respond that the Wise are called so because they have looked within themselves and conquered their own judgments and biases.

Indeed, seeking Truth in external objects is useless, because seen through the filter of the Mind, they are but reflections of the Self.

In contemplation and self-knowledge, one can grow closer to the Truth. After all, is it not true that some have great knowledge, but little true Wisdom?

Facts cannot lead one to Wisdom; only clarity of the heart, the ability to perceive what is hidden, can grant it.

The first and third Spearbills seem unconvinced, but the second appreciates your answer, ruffling its feathers in excitement.

<heron>Agreement! O hatchling of the Draak, may the blessing of Water, realm of Hidden Things and Perception, be upon you!</heron>

As one, they launch into the sky, and you hear them continuing their argument as they journey onward.

Event: d5bc

Truth and wisdom, you respond, are false labels placed on things. Objects are simply themselves, nothing more or less.

One can never understand Sun, or Earth, or the infinite Onesong in which they dance. One can only abandon understanding and experience the wonder of Life.

Why would a truly wise being waste time rating and judging themselves and others when they could simply plunge into the cool Waters of Life, and drink?

Why search for meaning in the green and rolling Earth, when one could simply rest in her Body, and taste of her Milk, which is Joy? Life is what one makes of it, and to be content with that is true Wisdom.

The first and second Spearbills seem unconvinced, but the third appreciates your answer, ruffling its feathers in excitement.

<heron>Agreement! O hatchling of the Draak, may the blessing of Earth, of simplicity and contentment, be upon you!</heron>

As one, they launch into the sky, and you hear them continuing their argument as they journey onward.

<heron>We have been outdone!</heron> cries one. <heron>Humility is the base of all three paths, the common force binding all.

<heron>Indeed,</heron> agrees the second. <heron>Knowledge cannot be gained without a realization of one's own ignorance; self-knowledge cannot be found without understanding one's own limitations; and emptiness cannot be discovered without a release of one's own pride and self-importance.</heron>

<heron>By refusing to compete, the Draak has won,</heron> says the third. <heron>We acknowledge its superiority, and will relate its victory to the Air.</heron>

Spreading their wings, they bow their heads in unison and then take wing. Their song echoes throughout the valley: <heron>The young Draak has wisdom!</heron>

Perhaps this shall bring you renown. You have certainly learned something this day about the importance of humility.

Many are the names for these pure, swift beings who, though quite large for a furbeast, move with an almost impossible grace. You have heard of them, but this is your first encounter with a Clan of their kind.

All of them bear a spirit-crown, which was said to have been given to them by the <color #4eee37>Spirit of the Great Green.</color> Incredibly, one of their crowns has even manifested physically, adorning its head in reality... powerful Music, indeed.

Event: d7

You have ranged far this Sun and are returning to your Lair when the dusk is suddenly split by the most beautiful sound you have ever heard.

It is not the work of just one animal; several beings are raising up a song, each of their voices distinct and important in the braided Music which pours out from them.

It can only be the mighty Clan-Singers, whose Music is renowned among all. These beautiful hunters are said to cultivate invisible, shining bonds between each others' souls, binding them together in Clans, which are then capable of carrying out fearsome, elaborate Dances of Destruction where many move with one Mind, one Will, to be victorious in battle and in the hunt.

Pausing, you listen to their Music:

<color 00b4ff><wolf>We are the People of the Far-telling Song,</color>
<color 1496ff>Who sing with One Voice, which is Many Voices.</color>
<color 2878ff>To be alone is Weakness,</color>
<color 3c5aff>To be together is Strength.</color>

<color 00b4ff><wolf>Praise be to the Great Green, shard of the Mother's Being,</color>
<color 1e69ff>Pouring out sweetness in the crystal-pure Waters</color>
<color 3c5aff>And the ruby-sweet Essence of our honorable Prey.</color>

<color 00b4ff><wolf>Praise be to our Prey, whose flesh becomes ours,</color>
<color 1e69ff>Givers of Life, Dance-partners eternal,</color>
<color 3c5aff>We remember with Song your great Sacrifice.</color>

<color 00b4ff><wolf>Praise be to Those Who Came Before,</color>
<color 1496ff>Our ancestors, who learned to walk across Love and Violence,</color>
<color 2878ff>Across being One and being Many,</color>
<color 3c5aff>And not be split in twain.</color>

<color 00b4ff><wolf>Praise be to Earth, Great Mother of us all,</color>
<color 1e69ff>For we Love Her, and are One in Her.</color>
<color 3c5aff>Hear now our Song of Joy:</color>

<color 00b4ff><wolf>We Live!</color>
<color 1e69ff>We Live!</color>
<color 3c5aff>We Live!</color>

Every voice is distinct, and yet they all flow together and around each other. When two strike the same note, they instantly split apart, so that each voice should always be heard, and yet each is a support and partner to every other. It is like a blessed forest, a Great Green of Music.

/MasteryDisplay

The Clan-Singers' Music is indeed wondrous, but their strange togetherness is somehow both right and wrong, brilliant and yet a violation of the spirit of independence, of Strength Alone, which guides the Kin.

In that moment, you feel...

------------------------------
> ...fascinated by their strange unity and the power it brings them.
  Go to: d7a
> ...disgusted by their foolish praise of cooperation and dependence.
  Go to: d7b

> ...indifference; these lesser furbeasts are nothing to you.
  Go to: d7d

==============================
Event: d7a

Could there be some hidden power in relying on others?

You were taught by the Voice that nothing is ever given in this life; you must take all things with your own mouth, your own claws, make your own Music, forge your own Way.

Most Draak would surely say that the Clan-Singers' song, while beautiful to hear, is a deception; only alone can one find the strength to grow and become truly Great.

And yet, the thought crosses your Mind that perhaps they are wrong. Perhaps you could somehow benefit from binding yourself to another.

But no sane Draak would willingly enter into either debasing servitude nor constraining leadership of another entity...

To even entertain the notion that the Singers have something to teach a Draak marks you as either a brilliant iconoclast or a weak, self-destructive fool. Time will tell which is the case.

For now, you content yourself to listen to their Music, which all agree is a wonder and a beauty.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d7b

Every Draak knows that only by facing the challenges of life alone can one grow to greatest strength; this is a teaching handed down from before the rise of the Clan-singers, indeed, before the existence of all of the furbeast People.

To rely on others may be strength for the weak, but for the strong, like the Draak, it is pure weakness and limitation.

By living, hunting, and ultimately facing Destruction alone, the Draak hone their Bodies and Essences into deadly perfection, the titanic strength which makes them known as greatest of all of the Children of Sun and Earth.

Their music may be beautiful, but their Way is doomed to failure. You follow an older, mightier path. Your soul will never become bonded to another.

You will keep the True Way.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d7c

You find their melodious celebration of life and the Great Powers infectious, and a pride and a joy swells within you.

As the Singers do, you raise your head skyward, so that your Song will go out to all of the Four Ways equally, and you Sing:

<player><color ff1414>Mine are the People Ancient of Days,</color></player>
<player><color ff3214>Lords of Destruction, bringing forth cleansing Fire.</color></italic>

<player><color ff5014>Though alone, I am strong; all shall know Fear</color></player>
<player><color ff6e14>When they face the Flame within my Breast, behind my Eyes.</color></italic>

<player><color ff8c14>Praise to Earth, Great Mother of us all,</color></player>

<player><color ffc814>I live, and feast, and grow Great;</color></player>
<player><color ffe614>I live! I live! I live!</color></player>

The Singers cease their Music for a time, listening to yours, and you feel both pride and fear, knowing you have gained their attention, and that at your age, that is a very dangerous thing. On other nights, you continue to hear their Music, and it makes you think strange thoughts.

The sound is different from anything else you have heard, you must admit, but the blabbering of young-souled furbeasts is not something you could honestly admire.

You follow something older, something much greater, and you will not be distracted by their garish declarations.

You do not need to Sing out your beliefs and your feelings. All you need lies within you, safe from the predations of Time.

Let the furbeasts weaken their Essence with the poison of dependence; their Way, which allows the unfit to survive by relying on others, will taint them.

Event: d8

As you are returning to your den at dusk, an odd keening noise draws your attention. Investigating, you discover a strange sight: two groups of tailless beings are rotating, gyrating on their spindly hind legs while clutching each other with their forepaws. What could this strange Dance be?

The dark ones are No-Tail Givers... you can smell their musky, oily scents, each one different. But the bright ones...

What are they? They appear somewhat like No-Tail Birthers, but they are most certainly not. Eerily, each one of them has the exact same smell, with not a trace of difference, as though they are just one being pretending to be many.

They are giving off a powerful Birther scent, perhaps too powerful, and laced with overtones of blackberries and lightning. And the heat radiating from their bodies makes them almost glow in your eyes. The shrill noise is coming from them, a Song of sorts, their voices lifted in a too-perfect harmony.

The No-Tail Givers seem transfixed by them, and as the Dance continues, the Brightlings (for that is what you have decided to call them) draw the Givers in closer and closer, allowing more and more touches from their forepaws.

One by one, the couples detach from the dance and retreat into the Trees, each pair separate from the others.

Finally, only one pair remains. What do you do?

------------------------------
> Attack the pair while they are distracted.
  Go to: d8a
> Wait, and when they leave, follow them into the Trees.
  Go to: d8b

  Go to: d8c

  Go to: d8d
> Return to your Den; this is not something to involve yourself in.
  Go to: d8e

==============================
Event: d8a

Swiftly and silently, you creep up on them. They seem wholly distracted with each other, which helps. The Birther seems less physically mighty, and so, when you are close enough, you leap at it, jaws wide.

It turns its pale lavender eyes to look at you...

And then, it is simply gone. You land on the ground, stumbling, and even with all your senses open, there is not a trace of the Brightling.

The Giver it was with seems as shocked as you are by the disappearance; confused and frightened, it rapidly stalks off on its two long legs in the direction of the No-Tail hive. By the time you have recovered from the surprise yourself, it is already halfway across the field.

Going after the Giver seems unwise. It has a head start, and without the element of surprise, you are not at all certain you could defeat an adult No-Tail alone, even if you could catch it.

What kind of animal has no personal scent, Dances with those not of its own Tribe, and disappears with neither sound nor light left behind?

These Brightlings... what could they be...?

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d8b

The No-Tail and the Brightling go a short distance into the forest, and then they start touching each other in different ways.

Ultimately, it seems as though they are wrestling, although you've never known a fight to be so devoid of fear, and though the Giver seems to be winning, the Birther doesn't seem to mind at all. Strange.

Eventually, they stop their bizarre Dance, and the Giver falls asleep. Then, before your very muzzle, the Brightling Birther simply disappears. No trace of it whatsoever remains, not even in scent.

The feathers on your crest stand on end... there is something very odd, very unnatural, going on here. You feel that you are in danger.

What do you do?

------------------------------
> Get out of here as fast as you can.
  Go to: d8ba
> The opportunity to attack a sleeping No-Tail is too good to pass up... attack the unconscious Giver!

  Go to: d8bc, d8bc

==============================
Event: d8ba

You have no idea what you just witnessed, which is genuinely terrifying. As you flee, you hear some kind of sound behind you, but you do not stop, and when you are certain you are not being followed, you pause to gather yourself.

What are the Brightlings? What are they doing with the No-Tails, and why? Perhaps a wiser Draak may know more...

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d8bb

It seems that the No-Tails can be Destroyed like other animals, though that was far more difficult; its bizarre movements make it a dangerous foe.

In addition to its oily meat (which is surprisingly delicious) the No-Tail had some kind of treasure fastened around its neck. You take it back to your den.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d8bc

Keeping your footfalls slow and gradual but your Body light, you creep up to the No-Tail's sleeping form and nibble through the string of Woodstrider skin, freeing the object. Taking it up in your jaws, you make a silent escape.

Back at your den, you find that there is something odd about the object you have found. Perhaps it is valuable in some way.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d8c

You attempt to Sing into the Giver's Mind, but there is some kind of interference, as though something else is already Singing to it, though in a completely different way.

Confused, the No-Tail shakes its half-naked head and looks around. Seeing you, it panics, and retreats.

The Brightling looks at you as well, but strangely, you scent neither fear nor surprise, only a kind of mild annoyance, before it suddenly vanishes, leaving absolutely no trace of light nor scent behind.

What are the Brightlings? What are they doing with the No-Tails, and why?

Perhaps a wiser Draak may know more...

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d8d

As you find the Brightling's eyes, you begin to Sing into its Mind, but your initial images are... well, there is no other word but "consumed" for it.

Its Mind is like a rainbow whirlpool, consuming your messages, sucking them away to somewhere else.

The Brightling subtly turns the No-Tail Giver in her arms away from you, and looking at you over its shoulder, begins to <shimmer><rainbow>Sing baaack aat yyoooouuuuuuuuuuu...</rainbow></shimmer>

When you next are aware of yourself, both the Brightling and the Tailless are gone. You are alone, and cold.

As you make your way back to your Den, you begin to wonder...

What are the Brightlings? What are they doing with the No-Tails, and why? Perhaps a wiser Draak may know more...

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d8e

There is clearly something wrong with this. The Tailless are always strange, but this seems odder than anything you have ever heard of.

Danger may loom, and here there is little hope for Treasure or food. You leave well enough alone, return to your Den, and sleep well.

  Go to: d9c

==============================
Event: d9a

The lair-trap sticks to your feathers and scales as you move through it, and its inhabitant springs into panicked activity. The Weaver scrambles down your flank and drops onto the leafy ground.

You rub your head against a nearby Fern to get the sticky substance off. By the time you finish cleaning yourself, the Weaver is already beginning the lengthy process of constructing a new lair from its own flesh-strings.

Briefly, you wonder if its Mind is complex enough to feel such things as sorrow or frustration, and whether that would render your destruction of its home any more or less of a tragedy.

The Weaver gives no sign, merely continuing to build its home with silent determination.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d9b

You backtrack a short distance, poking your snout through leafy fronds to find another way through. Eventually, you find one. Looking backwards, you see the Weaver still there, barely alive, spirit drawn tightly within, only a hint of light escaping.

Perhaps it is a prayer for some Tiny Being to trespass upon its sacred space so that it may feed. The Mind of a Weaver is, perhaps, best left undisturbed - strange things are sung of it.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: d9base

The Sun is still young when you come across a most fascinating Lair. Suspended between Plants, swaying gently in the morning breeze, it bars your way forward with utmost eloquence.

It is circles... many circles, circles within circles, like the Onesong which holds Earth and Sun and all worlds like small thoughts, soon to be forgotten.

Droplets of water hang from the structure like tiny, fragile gems.

At the center of it all, its spirit muted, almost scentless, rests a Weaver.

You know the Weaver Tribe by reputation. Their Way is old, even by the standards of the Draak. Among Tiny Beings, they are feared Destroyers, but pose no danger at all to a great Kin such as you.

Your path forward, however, is obstructed by this Weaver's trap-lair. Finding a way around would take effort - not very much, but some. The easiest way to continue is through. Surely, no beast of the Great Green would think twice before forging ahead... it would be madness to worry about every Tiny Being you encounter.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: d9

==============================
Event: d9c

You extend your Mind-song outward, searching for the Weaver's. It is very, very difficult for you to connect to its tiny consciousness, but finally, you feel something at the edge of the silence:

Standing near one of Darktooth's scent-marks, you have let out a Song of Annunciation, and after a short time, the elder Kin arrives. It settles its Body down among the hills like a low mist and waits for you to state your purpose. Naturally, any question must come with an appropriate payment.

<darktooth>IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS SUN, AND THERE WAS EARTH; IN A TRUE DANCE OF CREATION, THEY WERE ONE.

<darktooth>WHEN THEY CAME APART, EARTH CARRIED A BURNING SEED WITHIN HER, AND IN THE FULLNESS OF TIME, BROUGHT FORTH LIFE, FIRST THOSE OF TINY, SIMPLE MUSIC, AND THEN A VAST SYMPHONY OF BODIES AND MINDS.

<darktooth>AT LAST, SHE BIRTHED HER ULTIMATE CREATION: THE DRAAK-KIN, OUR PEOPLE, LIVING FULFILLMENT OF THE POWER OF EARTH AND SUN, TRUE CHILDREN OF ABOVE AND BELOW.

<darktooth>OF ALL BEASTS, WE ARE THE CREST, THE CROWNING FEATHERS; HIGH AND BEAUTIFUL ARE WE. OUR FANGS ARE CRAFTED OF EARTH'S UNYIELDING SUBSTANCE, OUR BREATH GLOWS WITH THE POWER OF SUN.

<darktooth>BY THESE GIFTS, WE BECAME THE BEARERS OF POWER, THE BEASTS BEFORE WHOM ALL OTHERS BOWED, AND ALL BEINGS WERE OUR PREY. THAT WAS THE GOLDEN AGE, THE TIME OF DOMINION.

<darktooth>THEN CAME THE SKYFALL, AND ALL FELL TO RUIN, BUT THAT IS A TRUTH NOT YET FOR YOUR YOUNG MIND. KNOW ONLY THAT WE ARE THE GREATEST OF ALL THOSE WHO EMBODY THE MUSIC OF THIS WORLD.

<darktooth>PREPARING FOR THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. MY ONLY COUNSEL:

<darktooth>ENDURE.

Faster than thought, Darktooth has pierced your flesh with its dark fang. The wound is tiny and shallow... it is obviously being gentle... and there is almost no pain, only a tiny bit of your Essence escaping. You wonder what agony it was talking about, and briefly entertain the possibility that you are extremely resistant to pain.

At last, you regain your senses. Darktooth is silent: there is nothing to sing. You are certain that poison, strong enough to kill the largest creatures of an age of titans, purged the fungus. Though it was just a tiny drop, it nearly wiped your very spirit from your Body.

This cure came at a high, high price indeed.

The long, clawless pawprints of the No-Tails have appeared dangerously near your Den, and their scent is now in the air when you awaken each new Sun.

Event: dx1

Here, the Tailless have built a kind of den for their Suncaller slaves. Finding them was not difficult; you only had to follow the unique cry of their Giver as the new Sun's light broke over the valley.

Suncallers are deeply religious, and even in captivity they keep their tradition of sunrise canticles to the Great Giver above.

They smell delicious... it is said that Sun's blessing upon their Essence makes them a clean and yet succulent meal.

Defeating one should not be too difficult, but beware... the No-tails are unlikely to take kindly to your predation upon their flesh-property.

Here, the hills are being slowly nibbled barren by a multitude of furbeasts. Members of the once-brave Surefoot tribe, they are now the slaves of the No-tails, weak and servile, though their flesh remains savory and healthful.

There are many, many of them here, mostly Birthers and hatchlings, and you could hunt here several times before their numbers grow thin.

Around their necks, and in the stone walls that enclose them, however, they bear the mark of servitude which the Tailless have placed upon them. Attacking these slaves of the No-Tails may provide much food, but there may be consequences in the future.

==============================
Event: dx3

You have drawn dangerously near to the No-Tail Hive.

It is a cacaphony of sounds and smells - the strange barking of the enslaved Clansingers, the squealing songs of the Tailless hatchlings, and stranger, rhythmic striking sounds of shinestone on shinestone mix with the acrid smell of their oily skins, the dead beast-pelts with which they cover their Bodies, and the smell of the slain Trees from which they make their dens. It is like something from an evil dream.

Somehow, they do not smell you, despite your nearness, and you doubt they could hear your footfalls through such a din, but their shinestone-clad, bronzefang-wielding Giver guardians look very dangerous.

Stealth may be an option; If their eyes are as weak as their noses, you could risk slipping into their Hive and succeed.

Your feathers are quivering... fear is resting in your throat, insistently advising that you stay away from these mysterious Other-Beings and their unknowable Way.

Event: dx3a

You have barely broken from cover when you are sensed - it seems that although Tailless noses are nearly worthless, their eyes are as good as yours, and perhaps even better.

A shouting cry goes up and the Hive stirs with activity as No-Tail warriors rush at you, their false fangs clutched in their forepaws.

If you stand your ground, you will face many of them, and you know not the secrets of their methods of Destruction - only that they Destroyed a fully-grown Kin on the day of your hatching.

Stand your ground?

  Go to: dx3escape

==============================
Event: dx3b

You find an unguarded section of the dead-Tree barrier they have erected around their Hive and, after several long exhalations of your deadly flame-breath, the wood begins to catch.

Very soon after, however, several No-Tail warriors descend on you, filling the air with their stone fangs, which they launch from bent sticks at high speed.

Not even able to approach them for a proper Dance of Destruction, you are left with no choice but to retreat.

When you are a safe distance away, you look back from a high place, hoping to see their Hive being consumed by Fire, but by cleverly transporting Water in containers and spreading it on the burning parts, they have annulled your flame, leaving only a little blackened Tree-barrier to mark your efforts.

It seems that they are even more resourceful than you feared. At least you were able to improve your fire-breath skills this day. Hopefully, it was worth it - the Tailless will no doubt be hunting you after such a brazen attempt on their home.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: dx3c

You manage to learn quite a few things of interest.

The Tailless are indeed noseblind (or near to it) and have poor hearing, but their sense of sight is keen - the guardians see their fellows approaching from farther away than you could, and can even identify individuals at a distance, judging by their varied reactions.

It gets far worse as the shadows grow long and Sun dies, however... they see well only in the light, and darkness is a weakness of theirs. They keep small flame spirits trapped on sticks to provide light as the land darkens.

They seem to limit the activities of the young, the old, the sick, the wounded, and the Birthers, who are mostly confined to the dens. All of their warriors and laborers are Givers, who are given more freedom, it seems, in exchange for a much higher risk of Destruction.

Their strange, chattering Songs are nearly endless. You can hear their voices constantly within the Hive. What could they possibly be communicating about for hundreds of heartbeats on end? Even more than singing featherbeasts and croaking greenleapers, the Tailless seem to love the sounds of their own voices, as though they fear Silence. They emit a strange panting ha-ha-ha sound occasionally, but you have no clue what causes it.

Suddenly, you are in jeopardy - a No-Tail warrior's slave-beast, a degenerate Clansinger, has smelled you, and is singing an all-too-clear Song of Warning to its masters, who are moving to investigate your hiding place, weapons at the ready.

If you stand your ground, you will face many of them, and you know not the secrets of their methods of Destruction - only that they Destroyed a fully-grown Kin on the day of your hatching.

Yes - if destroying a No-Tail Hive were easy, surely other Kin would have done so by now.

Their bizarre scents, sounds and movements are striking a terror into you such as you have never known, and fear is nearly making you lose control of your bodily functions. You wisely turn away from this probable invitation to suicide.

Good fortune shines upon you this day! Nearby, you find the Silent form of an infant Woodstrider. It is unclear what Destroyed it... it has no wounds upon its tender, juicy Body... but its spirit is gone, its Rhythm Quieted forever.

It is somewhat odd that it bears no marks of battle, and though it is a bit scrawny, it did not die of hunger.

Your keen senses detect some kind of swarm within it and around it, beings even tinier than the buzzing, armored Tiny Beings which share Earth with you. You decide to call them Very Tiny Beings, as they cannot be seen at all with the eye, only smelled, and then only vaguely.

The discovery causes a kind of disquiet within you, though you know not why.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dx4

==============================
Event: dx5

Your beautiful Body has come under attack by countless Very Tiny Beings.

Entering you as you might enter another Kin's territory, they are marauding your inner world, breaking, polluting and poisoning your Essence.

They did not even issue a formal challenge before their invasion. The entire affair is outrageously impolite, and made all the more frustrating in that you are unable to burn them or hunt them.

You cannot even use your Mind to its regular extent; it is largely preoccupied in fighting the invisible interlopers.

{QUESTIONABLE_MEAT=1 You cannot help but remember the questionable flesh you consumed a few Suns ago. You cannot be sure, but you have a sinking suspicion that it may be to blame.}
{QUESTIONABLE_MEAT!=1 Your only solace is in knowing that you made the right decision by not eating the questionable flesh of a few suns ago. If this was caused by simply being near it, as you suspect, it would surely be far worse had you succumbed to the temptation.}

You have little appetite, but perhaps some hunting might help your Body rally, or exploration re-stimulate your Mind.

Your Core is telling you to stay in your Den and not move, but the No-Tails continuously draw closer to discovering you (not to mention the fact that you feel restless and irritable). Darktooth may be able to provide advice, but the trek to its territory will be laborious and its assistance is, of course, never free.

What will you do?

------------------------------
> Remain in your den and do nothing for today.
  Go to: dx5a, dx5a

==============================
Event: dx5a

You huddle down in your earthen sanctuary and sleep as much as possible, following the directives of your Core.

You can only hope that this has given your internal forces some kind of advantage in the pitched battle raging inside of you. Perhaps resting more will help, though you feel awful.

It turns out to be a wise decision, as the illness will now depart more quickly, but this is not how a mighty Draak should spend its Suns.

------------------------------

Hauling your embattled Body over field, hill and stream, you finally come to Darktooth's territory. It appears after a short while, though your Song of Annunciation is rather lacking in volume.

<darktooth>THIS ONE SMELLS DIS-EASE WITHIN A YOUNG DRAAK,</darktooth> Darktooth communicates in its usual sharply-glowing Mind-song. After making an appropriate offering, it elucidates:

<darktooth>COUNTLESS BEINGS, TINY BEYOND PERCEPTION, SURROUND US AT ALL TIMES. MOST ARE HARMLESS, BUT A HOSTILE SWARM IS ATTACKING YOUR BODY.

<darktooth>SHOULD YOU SURVIVE, YOU MAY ULTIMATELY LEARN HOW TO PREVENT SUCH INVASIONS, BUT FOR NOW, YOU ARE SUBJECT TO THEIR PREDATIONS. RESTING IN YOUR LAIR UNTIL YOUR BODY IS VICTORIOUS IS A SLOW BUT EFFECTIVE SOLUTION.

You slink back to your Den. Tomorrow is another day. You can rest, if you wish to follow Darktooth's advice, until the Dis-Ease is defeated, or you can ignore it and go about your business.

Your Body will probably eventually rally on its own.

Probably.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: LairUI

==============================
Event: dx5cb

You are slightly alarmed as Darktooth's head bobs - too late, you realize what it is about to happen - and then your Body is bathed in a torrent of flame. Though your scales are heat-resistant, they do not stand a chance against a fire such as this, and your feathers are alight, your eyes squeezed shut as you are bathed in screaming heat.

Suddenly, you are doused, covered in a sticky mucus Darktooth spits on you to put out the flame.

<darktooth>I HAVE BURNED THE INTERLOPERS OUT OF YOU. RAISING THE TEMPERATURE OF YOUR BODY HELPS TO DRIVE THEM AWAY. REST TODAY, AND YOU WILL BE WELL TOMORROW.</darktooth>

Dazed and confused, you return to your Den, with considerable pain now added to the misery of your illness, but you find Darktooth to be ultimately correct: when the next Sun rises, the Dis-Ease is gone from your Body. Bathing in fire may be a drastic solution, but it is effective, at least for a Kin.

Most are too dull and common to be of any real interest, but a very few of them are quite beautiful.

You could spend a Sun or three here searching for worthy baubles to add to your trove. You will, of course, find fewer and fewer with each new search, as the high-quality stones grow harder and harder to find.

You find only one stone truly worthy this time, and are quite certain that this place holds nothing else of import to a Draak-Kin.

You grasp the Shakestick in your maw, aim it at the shinestone and press the indentations with a foreclaw.

The Air pulses with ripples like the disturbed surface of a pond, silent but still rattling your teeth, and the stone grasping the silver treasure is broken apart in shuddering fits right before your very muzzle, releasing chunks of its precious bounty.

There is almost too much to transport back to your den... it takes you a few trips... but your trove has grown immensely this day. For a hatchling, you now have great wealth. You go to sleep atop the shiny mass and dream all night of how vast your treasure-holdings shall grow.

You smell them long before you see them, dread slowly making your feathers stand erect. You have tarried too long in Heartbone Valley, and now the No-Tails, enemies of your people, have found your home.

Your sacred Trove has been violated; much of it has already been carried away, and two Tailless now guard your Den, awaiting the return of their brethren to take the last of your precious Treasure.

They have not yet sensed you, and so retreat is still possible. What will you do?

Your Essence burns within your Body... the No-Tails, those oily-skinned, Mind-warped Other-seed, have taken all that you have worked so hard to obtain. Though nothing in your nascent Trove compared to what an Elder might have, your pride as a Draak has been savaged.

Still, Life is the greatest of Treasures, and they have not claimed that. You are wise enough to know that fighting the No-Tails here would accomplish nothing but a swift Destruction, and the wide world is still full of Treasure for the taking.

You turn your back on your Den, reflecting with fire in your soul that if you but survive and grow great, you could return to this valley and burn the Tailless Hive to the ground. For now, though, your destiny lies elsewhere.

This cannot be borne! The fireseed rises within your throat, and your Core calls upon you to burn these interlopers and take back what is yours. Your Mind, however, begs you to flee; Life is the greatest Treasure, and you will very likely lose that if you face the two Tailless here.

Event: dzcf

You attempt to draw one of the Tailless away from the site, but they are not fooled; though you rush at your Den with all of your speed, you are struck with one of their flying claws-on-wood and pierced by the Warrior's fang-on-a-branch as you enter the Den.

You have time to take only one Artifact! Quickly; what shall it be?

==============================
Event: dzcf_choice

You burst out of the Den, narrowly evading a piercing Destruction from the Warrior. As you blindly scramble away, however, you are caught by a trap set by the No-Tail Hunter! As you struggle to free yourself from the snare, the Hunter appears to Destroy you!

Stunned by the ferocity of your defence, the No-Tails retreat, flailing their upper appendages and singing shrilly. You break free from the snare and race coldwards to the only safe place left for you...

Cleverly, you cause a disturbance in the nearby brush, luring the Hunter away, then circle back around and swiftly charge into your Den. The Warrior follows you inside, and you have time to take only one Artifact!

Quickly; what shall it be?

Event: dzcs_choice

The Warrior strikes at you, but you feint to one side, then another, and then flee the Den and away coldwards with the speed of Air itself until you are far away. There is only one place you can go, now.

==============================
Event: memory_fang_act1

The crystal is so large that it fills up your hatchling mouth, but you manage not to choke on it as you drift into the Dreaming...

...

Something is guiding you, pulling you along by your Essence. You see... something behind... reality? A portal?

A swell of Earth, covered in Trees?

A great Kin?

You see so many things, but your young Mind can only comprehend so much. The hill you saw is certainly not in Heartbone Valley, and was that Draak...?

Too much. Too much!

Your distress has awakened you prematurely from the eddies of the Dreaming through which the Crystal Fang was guiding you.

You remember some things, experiences which give you a taste of the power of an adult of your mighty kind...

But there was more to be seen, you cannot help but feel. As you are now, though, you have learned all you can from this. Spitting out the shattered bits of crystal, you feel stronger than before.
