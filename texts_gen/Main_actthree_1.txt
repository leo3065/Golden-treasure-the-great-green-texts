Event: f001

Like a sticky mire burying your Mind in a grasping yet breathable darkness.

Like a boulder, grey and thought-hollow, unsouled and yet undeniable.

Like a dream of nothing at all.

If you had to, perhaps you could try to convey the feeling of this Great Sleep to another in such ways. It is being sucked down and built up simultaneously, squeezed comfortably between layers of Is and Is-Not.

There is absolutely no way to know how many Suns or Moons or Turnings have passed. Time itself is resting, curled under and around you.

When the morass recedes, leaving you real and physical once more, the power of the Rhythm beating in your breasts is a slow surprise. Was it this strong before?

Breaking out of your sealed sleep-chamber is much easier than the last time, as well. Even after doing so, there is not enough room for you to stretch properly, so you emerge...

Event: f001a

There is no need to consult your reflection this time. You feel it deep in your Core. You are now complete.

Your Body has gone through its final transformation, leaving you a living glory.

No Draak on Earth would call you a hatchling now. Through many hunts, many trials, you have at last become an adult. At long last, your Body is a fitting temple for your Kin-Essence.

The cool Air caresses your new Body tenderly, so tenderly. You feel the root of every one of your hundreds of feathers quivering in the stiff breeze. It makes you shiver with delight.

<i>Come,</i> it seems to sing. <i>I find you worthy. Become one with me.</i>

Freedom.

You were chained and did not know, bound and ignorant, until now.

Broad-breasted Earth is spread wide far below. Sun alone reigns above. You feel their joining, and you are their joining.

You want to Sing for pure joy, have to Sing... but the terrible, fierce fulfillment is too much, and catches the sound in your throat. There is too much deep pleasure for you to even make a sound.

All you can do is keep on moving, keep sliding between Earth and Sun with a velocity unknown.

You feel the eyes of many goodbeasts far below as they look up in wonder at your vast form sailing the Great Above. Even the featherbeasts must envy you, soaring at a height their tiny limbs could never achieve; the thin, cold Air here in the highest bows only to your broad, strong wings.

You soar low over high hills, feeling the warmer Air there pushing you gently upwards again; you pass through clouds which lick you with cool, watery tongues, bathing you.

A few times, the wind seems to push you violently, but you soon learn that fighting it is useless. Only by merging with it, feeling it, acknowledging its desires can you proceed, and it becomes your dance-partner, carrying and turning you gracefully.

By the time you near the Great Blue, you have calmed down enough to sing, and you open your jaws and roar with beauty:

<player>Behold me, Mother Earth!
Behold me, Father Sun!</player>

<player>At last, I am worthy!
Here I Dance, in the High Lair!</player>

<player>I am Draak-Kin! Feel the cool of my skin,
The heat of my Breath!</player>

<player>I am the Wealth of Earth! I am Sun's Favored Treasure!</player>

<player>Behold! Behold! Behold!</player>

Your Songs and Dances of Joy are soon interrupted, however. A great shadow approaches you, wheeling in from above.

Its vastness shocks you into silence, but soon, you recognize it as the elder, Darktooth.

You feel no defensiveness nor territorial enmity; the Great Above belongs to no one. Still, there is an urgency in the ancient one's voice and a veil of caution over its Mind-song which makes you uneasy:

<darktooth>IN THE NAME OF THE FUTURE, I SUMMON YOU, NEWLY-AWAKENED. A GRAND MOOT HAS BEEN CALLED.</darktooth>

<darktooth>THE THREAT POSED BY THE SEED OF THE OTHERS CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED. IN YOUR SLUMBER, THEY HAVE GROWN MIGHTIER STILL.</darktooth>

<darktooth>THE GREATEST OF OUR PEOPLE HAVE PLEDGED TO FIND A FINAL SOLUTION TO THIS MENACE.</darktooth>

<darktooth>SOON, YOU SHALL JOIN THE MASS-FLIGHT AND TRAVEL TO THE CHOSEN PLACE TO BEAR WITNESS TO THE DEBATE AND ACKNOWLEDGE ITS RESULTING ORDER.</darktooth>

<darktooth>REFUSAL IS NOT AN OPTION. YOU WILL ATTEND. THE ELDERS OF YOUR PEOPLE COMMAND IT.</darktooth>

You feel Darktooth's Song of Command burrowing deep into your Mind, taking root there. You will be helpless to spurn its call when the time comes.

Will you address the great Elder?

Darktooth signals acceptance by turning its huge Body slightly and wheeling away from you, leaving you to return home carrying a new burden.

What are the No-Tails, that their danger is such that the solitary Kin must put aside their own Way to join together and face them?

What gives them such power, and what solution could there be? What are the Elders planning?

The unchanging wind suddenly seems colder, and your earlier bliss is fading. You sense that a turning point in the High Story of your People is drawing near.

Now that you are an adult, you, too, must learn all you can about the Tailless and their Way, and turn your Mind to a solution, as the Elders have done, if you are to be worthy to affect the Great Moment which looms ahead.

Event: f001df

You spend the first few Suns after your awakening surveying your domain and broadening your Lair to fit your new Body and the many Treasures you will surely amass.

As you slept, a terrific spirit of Fire seems to have emerged and fed upon your lush, overgrown land. Many of the goodbeast tribes that sustained your Life have fled for other territories.

A few of your old hunting grounds remain, but you will almost certainly have to find food outside of the Spiritwood as it heals. To complicate matters, your adult Body will need more fuel than ever; smaller beasts will no longer suffice.

Hillbacks, Plainsrunners, Woodstriders and Great Grazers are worthy targets, though the occasional Surefoot or Tusksnort would not go amiss. There may not be enough of them left here, however.

The Fire's carnage will likely force you to turn your attention outwards. You are now Great enough to challenge your neighbors for portions of their lands.

New hunting grounds and encounters may be yours if you can defeat them in a challenge, but expect no quarter. They will surely bring all of their power to bear to keep what is theirs.

The Old Tree and most of the sacred Glen escaped the Fire. A visit to the Spirit of the Green may be in order; Its well-being and yours remain linked.

The Tailless have grown strong in the low lands coldward along the Great Blue. Food and Treasure may now be there for the winning, and perhaps something more...

Your time may also be well-spent seeking out the nearby Elders whose Songs will dominate the coming debate. They will test those who wish to communicate with them, but there is much to learn from them, as there always will be until the Void at last claims them.

This time, the Last Time of Freedom, is now yours. Take control of your Life, and Live. The Grand Moot awaits.

You spend the first few Suns after your awakening as an adult broadening your Lair to fit your new frame and the many Treasures you will surely amass.

In your mostly-absence, the Woodstriders have continued pruning and tending your lands. Your portion of the Great Green is bursting with health and Life. Prey is abundant, and you shall not want.

As your Body has grown, so has your appetite. Smaller beasts are no longer worth your attention. To fuel this great form, you must hunt larger beings.

Hillbacks, Plainsrunners, Woodstriders and Great Grazers are worthy targets, though the occasional Surefoot or Tusksnort would not go amiss.

Having already spent a great deal of time investigating your own demesne, it is now time for you to turn your attention outwards. You are now Great enough to challenge your neighbors for portions of their lands.

New hunting grounds and encounters may be yours if you can defeat them in a challenge, but expect no quarter. They will surely bring all of their power to bear to keep what is theirs.

A visit to the Spirit of the Green is in order; you should present yourself in your final form and commune with it. Its well-being and yours are one in many ways.

The Tailless have grown strong in the low lands coldward along the Great Blue. Food and Treasure may now be there for the winning, and perhaps something more...

The Sacred Glen.

Though your eyes see only a wooded hollow, your whole being can sense the deeper Truth. This is a living labyrinth, tenderly maintained by many subtle beings who have been drawn here over the ages.

The Essence-lines of Earth Herself converge here, each pathway a vein or artery coursing inexorably toward or away from the Heart, where old is made new.

Now that you have trod the clouds, you can bypass the maze and fly straight to the center, but only the worthy may stand in the glory of the Living One.

Dare you approach?

==============================
Event: f002af

You alight before the Tree, sniffing cautiously around the chamber formed in the bole. Once you feel ready, you enter.

Even as an adult, there is somehow more than enough room for you here. You lie down and close off your senses one by one until your Body is perfectly still save for the thrum of the Rhythm.

Sleep sets in to your flesh, and your Mind dances with excitement, hope and fear as you imagine what the Spirit of the Green will reveal, will give to its favored Fang...

Truths unknown even to the Elders? Treasures never before tasted by any of your People?

Your desires pull you in many directions at once...

You awaken much later.

Sun is dying, and you know better than to be here when darkness falls, for Night and the Great Green are lovers. Even a great Draak would be crushed between their truths when they come together.

You had dreams, but they were not True Dreams, merely shoals of your own hopes and expectations. It seems that you were not worthy.

Only when you have achieved a high degree of mastery in all four of the elements will your Essence be sweet enough to attract such a mighty being as the Green Spirit.

This Sun yielded little save the knowledge that there is still more for you to learn before you are ready to enter into the presence of a truer being than yourself.

You alight before the Tree. Humbly, you fold your wings, bow your head, and surrender your pride as you enter the chamber between the roots.

Even as an adult, there is somehow more than enough room for you here. You lie down and close off your senses one by one until your Body is perfectly still save for the thrum of the Rhythm.

Sleep sets in to your flesh, and your Mind is tempted to follow one of millions of false pathways leading to shallower pools within the Dreaming...

But from Air you have learned intelligence and self-expression...

From Fire, you have learned passion and strength...

From Water, you have learned flexibility and perspicacity...

And from Earth, you have learned humility and fortitude.

You cannot be distracted or deceived. Your way cannot be barred.

Temptation is powerless before your hard-forged Will. Poised in the center, you abide.

Multiplicities and distinctions fade as the many become Four, and Four becomes One...

The Empire of Reeds. Water's blessing lies heavy here, and Life abounds in diverse forms.

Featherbeast and Waterbound alike hunt and are hunted in an endless round among the whispering Reeds, who protect all without design. They whisper as Air sweeps over them, and the thousand surface-pools shiver in the wind.

As you fly over it, taking the greys, greens and blues into your eyes, a delicious aroma rises up of fertility and decay. You can bear it no longer, and cry out a challenge:

<player>O Tempest, Lord of the Reedlands!
Your Empire is fraught with Life;
It calls to me!</player>

<player>Surrender to me its coldward horizon,
All that lies within sight or scent of the Spiritwood,
For I name it unto myself;</player>

<player>The warmcool Waters, the savory flesh
Of those who dwell neither in the Green nor the Blue
But both, and neither.</player>

<player>I have grown mighty indeed. Behold, I cover the sky!
Put not your teeth against mine,
Or this Sun, you shall dine upon your own Essence.</player>

Every sway of the Reeds, every ripple of the marsh could be the first sign of your foe.

You spot a sudden turbulence in one of the deep pools below and prepare to tuck in your wings and dive for an assault...

And are shocked when you are struck from above by what feels like a feathered mountain. You are already plummeting down to Earth and pain is lancing through you by the time you realize what has struck you.

You expected Tempest to come at you from below; how did this happen?! There is no time to wonder, though... feathers and essence are tumbling upwards as you fall from the sky.

{!HASABILITY_HYPERIMMUNE {!TREASURE_BEZOAR A wrenching nausea splits your Core; Tempest's initial attack has poisoned you. Struggling to gain the upper jaw, you twist and turn. Despite your boast, already you are tasting your own Essence.

Tempest seems to be concentrating more on keeping your head and wings under its own than doing damage to you. So constricted, you can barely breathe and cannot Sing at all. You must fight for your life!

Event: f003as

You barely sense it in time; something is just above you. Twisting, you narrowly avoid Tempest's poisoned fangs, shoving its head away as it wraps its Body around you.

Somehow, Tempest was able to blend with the sky itself, which you did not even think possible. If you were not so flexible and attuned to your deep senses, you would likely be poisoned and already losing the fight.

Surprisingly, Tempest seems to be concentrating more on controlling your Body than damaging it, keeping your head and wings beneath its own. You briefly wonder why...

And then it dawns on you. Tempest is going to smash you into the ground. Perhaps it intends to release you at the last moment and avoid the collision itself, or it may simply crash as well and use your Body to cushion its own fall.

Either way, you have a very short time to damage Tempest enough to force it to let go before you slam into Earth, as from this height you would be lucky just to survive. The Dance begins!

Unable to break free from Tempest's grip, you collide headfirst with the Water. From such a height, the sudden contact is like being smashed into a wall of Stone; you are sure you have broken several of the finer bones in your wings.

You barely have time to prepare before the Reedlord opens its maw, and...

You are on the ground, vomiting copiously. The sound...

Something warm and thick is pouring from your ears. The realization that it is your own Essence is not as terrifying as the sound itself.

The sound...

Later, you would wonder if it was an artifact of some kind or a True Song. You would never again feel anything like it, Earth and Sun be blessed.

It is finally over. Tempest stands over you. You are a breath away from Destruction.

Unsure of whether or not you are still alive, you haul what feels like your carcass upright and fix your bleeding eyes on Tempest.

Tempest replies with the last thing you expect:

<tempest>I SURRENDER.</tempest>

Perhaps you looked surprised, in your half-dead way.

<tempest>IF YOU DESIRE MY LAND WITH SUCH PASSION THAT YOU WOULD REACH FOR IT EVEN AFTER THAT, THEN I ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR LOVE FOR IT.</tempest>

<tempest>TAKE FROM IT AS YOU DESIRE, BUT IF YOU DARE TO ABUSE IT...</tempest>

<tempest>I SHALL BECOME ITS VENGEANCE.</tempest>

Thus it was that you came into possession of the coldward expanse of the Empire of Reeds. Never again did you put yourself against Tempest the Reedlord. Neither of you were in doubt about what would have occurred had you done so.

A new hunting ground has become yours and your renown among your People has grown. A new encounter awaits with the potential to change the fate of the Kin.

Even so, this is still the Empire of Reeds, and the Reedlord remains its true sovereign. Perhaps the time will come when you could challenge Tempest for it in its entirety...

But for a reason even you do not fully understand, you have little desire to.

<player>As my own Essence, so shall be its streams and tarns.</player>

<player>With a gentle claw, and with gratitude, shall I harvest its goodbeasts, taking them inside and becoming one with them.</player>

<player>So shall my actions be; if it is not so,</player>

<player>May my Body drown in these Waters, so that at least in Destruction I should become one with this good and fertile land.</player>

Tempest replies with a single glowing sigil:

<tempest>I SURRENDER.</tempest>

<tempest>IF YOU SING OF MY LAND WITH SUCH PASSION, THEN I ACKNOWLEDGE YOUR LOVE FOR IT.</tempest>

<tempest>TAKE FROM IT AS YOU DESIRE, BUT IF YOU DARE TO ABUSE IT...</tempest>

<tempest>I SHALL BECOME ITS VENGEANCE.</tempest>

So it was that you came into possession of the coldward expanse of the Empire of Reeds. Never again did you put yourself against Tempest the Reedlord. Neither of you were in doubt about what would have occurred had you done so.

A new hunting ground has become yours and your renown among your People has grown. A new encounter awaits with the potential to change the fate of the Kin.

Even so,this is still the Empire of Reeds, and the Reedlord remains its true sovereign. Perhaps the time will come when you could challenge Tempest for it in its entirety...

But for a reason even you do not fully understand, you have little desire to.

You gather all of your Essence, open your maw and sing the True Song of Destruction.

The nearby Reeds wither; Waterbound beasts in the nearby pools perish and float to the surface.

<tempest>IMPOSSIBLE! ONE SO YOUNG... HOW...</tempest>

The Body of a Spearbill which had the Rhythm of Life only moments ago floats by on the suddenly brackish water. The clouds begin to scream.

<tempest>ENOUGH! I SURRENDER.</tempest>

<tempest>EVEN IF I COULD ENDURE IT... I WILL NOT SUBJECT MY BELOVED LAND TO THAT.</tempest>

<tempest>SWEAR ONLY THAT YOU WILL HARVEST FROM THE EMPIRE OF REEDS WITH YOUR OWN BODY, YOUR CLAWS AND TEETH, AS WAS MEANT TO BE.</tempest>

<tempest>TO DISHONOR ONE'S PREY BY DENYING IT A FINAL DANCE OF DESTRUCTION IS WRONG.</tempest>

As it withdraws, Tempest looks back at you once.

<tempest>HAVING POWER AND KNOWING WHEN TO USE IT ARE VERY DIFFERENT, IT WOULD SEEM.</tempest>

Thus it was that you came into possession of the coldward expanse of the Empire of Reeds. Never again did you put yourself against Tempest the Reedlord. Neither of you were in doubt about what would have occurred had you done so.

A new hunting ground has become yours and your renown among your People has grown. A new encounter awaits with the potential to change the fate of the Kin.

Event: f003dd

Tempest's eyes go wide as it realizes what you are doing.

<tempest>IMPOSSIBLE! ONE SO YOUNG... HOW...</tempest>

You continue your Song, and Tempest's head is dragged down towards the ground unwillingly. It seems to be resisting with all of its might.

<tempest>HOW DARE YOU... FORCE ME TO...</tempest>

<tempest>I CURSE YOU... MAY YOU DROWN IN THESE WATERS... MAY THE LEAST-BEASTS FEAST ON YOUR... ESSENCE...</tempest>

<tempest>I... SURRENDER.</tempest>

Your command to surrender fulfilled, Tempest turns from you and begins to sink into the water.

<tempest>YOU ARE NOT ELDER THAN I, NOR WERE MY ACTIONS UNJUST. YOU SULLY THE SACRED TRUE SONG BY USING IT TO FORCE A KIN TO GIVE AWAY THE LAND IT LOVES, THE LAND IT HAS SUFFERED FOR.</tempest>

<tempest>I WILL HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH SUCH AN ARROGANT ONE AS YOU. PERISH SWIFTLY, SO THAT I CAN RECLAIM WHAT IS MINE BY RIGHT.</tempest>

Thus it was that you came into possession of the coldward expanse of the Empire of Reeds. Never again did you put yourself against Tempest the Reedlord. Neither of you were in doubt about what would have occurred had you done so.

A new hunting ground has become yours. A new encounter awaits with the potential to change the fate of the Kin.

Your renown among your people is unchanged; the glory you gain by being capable of a True Song of Dominion at such a tender age is offset by the ignominy of using it against another Kin with more of a right to the land than you.

Even though you now own a portion of it, this is still the Empire of Reeds, and the Reedlord remains its true sovereign. Perhaps the time will come when you could challenge Tempest for it in its entirety...

But for a reason even you do not fully understand, you have little desire to.

------------------------------

==============================
Event: f003f

With the shadow of Destruction looming over you, you flee away, splashing through shallow pools and scrambling over small islands. Crossing the scent-boundary, you hazard a backward glance only to find Tempest right behind you.

<tempest>THIS IS THE EMPIRE OF REEDS.</tempest>

<tempest>EVERY DROP OF WATER WITHIN IT IS KNOWN TO ME. EVERY BLADE OF GRASS, EVERY CREATURE, HAS BEEN BLESSED WITH MY SPIRIT.</tempest>

<tempest>I HAVE SHAPED ITS EVERY POOL, CARVED OUT ITS UNDER-HOLLOWS. IT HAS DIVULGED EVERY SECRET, EVERY HIDDEN PLACE, TO ME, ITS LOVER AND SOVEREIGN.</tempest>

<tempest>EVEN IF YOU WERE TO DESTROY ME, MY BREATH WOULD REMAIN IN THE WIND HERE, MY ESSENCE FLOW IN THE MUDDY CURRENTS.</tempest>

<tempest>I CARRY THIS EMPIRE WITHIN ME, AS IT CARRIES ME WITHIN IT.</tempest>

<tempest>I AM THUS IMMORTAL.</tempest>

Dying Sun casts a glow-boon over the many surfaces of the marshland. You hear the voice of a featherbeast praising Tempest:

<heron><color #c0c0ff><italic>The battle is over! Justice endures! The Blue Thunder is victorious!</color></italic></heron>

Though you have been defeated, you have at least gained one thing: a clearer vision of both the might and Music of a land rightly ruled by one of your own People.

Perhaps, one day, your own prey will lift up a song of thanksgiving for your dominion.

Event: f004_1

Here at the edge of the Empire of Reeds, a curious edifice stands.

Though it is made from good, damp Earth-flesh and blends well with the land surrounding it, the strange top and the Woodstrider skin grimly hung across the entrance leave no doubt...

This is a No-Tail dwelling.

Strangely, however, the smell of the No-Tails is rather light here. The air tastes fairly clean, and is rife with interesting overtones; sweet Herbs, ash, feathers, and... something like a Slideclaw?

Very odd.

------------------------------

  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: f004_1a

The dwelling is too small for your glorious Body to enter without issue, but your head and neck should fit. You quietly push aside the Woodstrider skin with your nose and investigate.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f004_1a1

==============================
Event: f004_1a1

The Lair contains... many things.

Despite the many furbeast pelts and the fleshless Shrieker-corpse somehow fastened to the wall, the reek of decay is absent.

Instead, the Air here is warm, making you want to yawn, and redolent with the sweet odors of lavender and sage.

A light calmness sets into your Mind. It is odd; usually being near anything associated with No-Tails would cause you alarm, but there is something different about this place.

A Shorttail Slideclaw lounges expertly on the remains of a Great Lumberer, raising its head slightly as you enter and addressing you.

<lynx>Do you seek the Artist?</lynx>

The Slideclaw blinks slowly, waiting.

------------------------------
> Ask about the "Artist".
  Go to: f004_1a1a
> Ask the Slideclaw about itself.
  Go to: f004_1a1b
> Ask about the Blackburn in the back.

  Go to: f004_1a1d
> Say that you have heard enough.
  Go to: f004_1a1e

==============================
Event: f004_1a1a

<lynx>Yes, the Artist; the Tailless Creator.</lynx>

<lynx>Not my Creator, nor that of any living being, of course, but a Creator nonetheless.</lynx>

<lynx>The Artist, as I name it, is transfixed with the beauty of Nature. It will spend whole Suns doing nothing but studying the many masterpieces of Mother Earth; a green-golden leaf from a venerable Tree, the patterns within the Clouds, even the Bodies of Goodbeasts.</lynx>

<lynx>It then Creates marvelous things, mostly Plant-blends which can banish Dis-Ease and hasten healing, but other things as well.</lynx>

<lynx>It also makes Music, sometimes with its own voice and sometimes with other objects. It uses this Music to praise Sun at His rising and setting, Moon as it slims and fattens, and Earth at all times.</lynx>

<lynx>It never eats flesh. Instead, it combines Plants, Water and Fire to create nourishment in yet another form of Art.</lynx>

<lynx>Each creation reveals and magnifies the hidden patterns present in all of Reality. Never have I seen or smelled such a bizarre yet wondrous Way.</lynx>

<lynx>Still, I do not believe there is anything here that would especially interest an avaricious Draak-Kin. The few chips of gems and shinestone it keeps would be too small for an adult of your People to bother with.</lynx>



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f004_1a1

==============================
Event: f004_1a1b

<lynx>My People, the Shorttail Slideclaws, are the shamans and seers of our kind. Though we have lived in these lands for Turnings beyond knowledge, few now remain, most of us having gone coldward and riseward for reasons which would not concern the mighty Kin.</lynx>

<lynx>Like all Slideclaws, we are of such perfection that mere survival is no longer interesting to us; instead, we seek Amusement.</lynx>

<lynx>Unlike the arrogant Lesser and brutal Great Slideclaw, alone among our kind, we find Amusement in the discovery of that which we call Art.</lynx>

<lynx>Earth has enclosed within Herself and Her myriad creations hidden patterns and beautiful secrets. We seek out these works of Life-Art and then treasure them in our Minds.</lynx>

<lynx>We ourselves are a work of Art, as are you, o Draak. A harmony of competing symmetries, flowing flesh and intention.</lynx>



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f004_1a1

==============================
Event: f004_1a1c

The Slideclaw glances towards the Featherbeast perching on the branch in the back of the Lair, then yawns dismissively.

<lynx>That old thing?</lynx>

<lynx>It has been here with the Artist for even longer than I have, and that is long indeed.</lynx>

<lynx>It rarely moves. I don't believe it can truly fly anymore. I have never seen it do so.</lynx>

<lynx>Every once in a great while, it sings, but its songs make no sense.</lynx>

<lynx>I have no idea why the Artist continues to allow its presence. It is more a pile of dirty feathers and hollow bones than a proper Goodbeast.</lynx>

<lynx>You are better off not concerning yourself with it.</lynx>

You glance over at it, feeling a tickle in your Mind like a distant song, but the Blackburn appears to be fast asleep.



------------------------------
> [Continue]

==============================
Event: f004_1a1d

<lynx>I am uncertain, but its journeys away from here have been shortening of late. Old Age has withered its flesh and bent its bones.</lynx>

<lynx>Its Mind is sharp as a fang, but such a thing is of no avail against the Great Void.</lynx>

<lynx>No doubt the Artist will return soon. It no longer has the strength to travel far. If you return at another Sun, it will probably be here.</lynx>

The Shorttail Slideclaw stretches. <lynx>What occurs now, mighty Draak?</cat>

<lynx>There are rumors that the Draak-Kin, even mighty as they are, fear the No-Tails and Destroy them when they can.</cat>

<lynx>Will you Destroy this place and deprive Earth of a great Artist, or risk the wrath of your People by letting it stand?</cat>



------------------------------
> Destroy it.
  Go to: f004_1a1ea
> Let it stand, for now.
  Go to: f004_1a1eb

==============================
Event: f004_1a1ea

You allow your actions to be your response; withdrawing from the interior, you grasp the grassy top in your jaws and begin to tear it away.

Soon, only the mud walls remain, which you smash down blow by blow. The Slideclaw flees, of course, though the Blackburn stays, perching on a nearby Tree and watching your one-sided Dance of Destruction.

You purge the area with your flames and cast whatever will not burn into the marsh. This welt upon Earth's Body must be expunged.

Though you remain vigilant, the Tailless which constructed it never returns. Still, you have proven that you do not fear the wrath of the Tailless, a message not lost on your own People.

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: f004_1a1eb

In silent response, you remove your head from the entryway and depart. This mud-mound will stand, at least for now.

After all, the Slideclaw's talk of an "Artist" was intriguing. Perhaps another visit will allow you to meet it. It is only fair to smell the truth for yourself before passing judgment.

------------------------------

You have returned to the Tailless Lair on the outskirts of the Empire of Reeds.

Hoping to find the mysterious Artist, you look inside...



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f004_21

==============================
Event: f004_21

That must be it. It is hard to tell, as it has wrapped itself in some kind of skin-cocoon, but it is definitely a Tailless, an old Giver of its kind. The long fur of its face blends with that of its head and trails nearly to the ground.

It bows its head to you, once, and then sits still. You smell very little fear in the Air.

There is something about this being which provokes a deep curiosity within you. Perhaps if you offered it something a token, you could ingratiate it.

On the other hand, it is Tailless, and they are rumored to be treacherous. Whatever you give may be used against you and the Kin in time.

Perhaps simply Destroying it is wise...

------------------------------
> Show it the Amber Circle.

> Leave, for now.
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: f004_21a

You drop the string of amber stones which you obtained so long ago, in Heartbone Valley, on the dirt floor.

Slowly, the No-Tail struggles up into its bizarre, upright stance, and picks it up in its smooth paws.

As it gazes at the circle of amber stones, water begins to drip from its eyes, flowing down its flat face. It lets out a muffled cry; is it melting?

Then it looks up into your eyes and does something you believed impossible:

It Sings to you.

<druid>I... REMEMBER.</druid>

<druid>SO LONG. SO LONG TIME. CHILDREN, I CHILD, YOU CHILD, BY VALLEY-RIVER.</druid>

<druid>I REMEMBER, I DREAM, I HOPE. NOW RETURNED.</druid>

<druid>I OLD. YOU, BEAUTIFUL.</druid>

Its sigils are crude and shaky, but it is... it is singing. It has been long believed that the Tailless cannot truly communicate as other beings do, Mind-to-Mind; some say their Minds are too polluted, others too foreign, too different from that of those born true of Earth.

But this one is different. Perhaps it was Created so, or perhaps changed by its encounter with you unknown Turnings ago in Heartbone Valley. Perhaps it is merely very strong within.

Before you can respond, it seizes a small container from the slab of Stone in the back. Examining your Body carefully, it gently rubs a cool white salve on any visible wounds, burns or sores.

==============================
Event: f004_21ba

You drop your offering on the dirt floor. Slowly, the No-Tail struggles up into its bizarre, upright stance, and picks it up in its smooth, thin paws.

It examines the object carefully, turning it over, before placing it on the slab of Stone, and then it looks at you and does something surprising:

It Sings.

<druid>YOU... GREAT. HONOR. GIFT.</druid>

Picking up a small piece of sharpstone, it draws the covering back from one of its forelegs and cuts itself. Its red Essence gleams as it stretches out the limb toward your nose.

<druid>GIFT. RETURN. ACCEPT.</druid>

It is difficult not to be impressed by such a personal gift as one's own Essence, and besides, it smells fantastic. You lick the tiny wound clean.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f004_3

==============================
Event: f004_21c

The bizarre No-Tail is wizened and weak; it burns well, like old, dry Tree-fingers, and does not make as much noise as you expected.

The Blackburn also perishes in your flames, though the Slideclaw manages to escape. A combination of more flames and brute strength reduces the Lair to a charred lump of debris. In one Turning, it will all be washed away by the rain and the grasping marshland.

Much later, you learn that this particular Tailless was a very valuable member of its Tribe, so much so that you successfully weakened them as a species with this act of judgment.

Sometimes, it is better to choose the red path, as you have. Even if they have the potential for good, some things should simply not exist.

Event: f004_3

The Artist looks at you. You wish it had a tail; it is very difficult to know what it is thinking without one. At last, with great effort, it stares at you and Sings:

<druid>WILL GIVE. GIVE MUCH. YOU GIVE, YOU RECEIVE.</druid>

The Artist is surprised at this question, for some reason. It strokes its facefur, thinking, before finally responding.

<druid>GODS...</druid> it points upwards... <druid>GODS COME, COME DOWN. MAKE US, TO HELP. HELPERS.</druid>

<druid>HELP TEND EARTH. HELP SAVE. DESTROY....</druid>

It pauses, and then comes up with a sigil.

<druid>CHAOS. DESTROY CHAOS.</druid>

<druid>SOME GOOD, REMEMBER THAT HELPERS, KEEP HELPING, TRY.</druid>

<druid>SOME FORGET THAT HELPERS. NO HELP. JUST SELF. FORGET EARTH. FORGET GODS. WANT EVERYTHING.</druid>

It struggles, searching for something, then seems to find it.

<druid>FRIENDS IS, WHEN SEEING, JOY. I SEE FRIEND, I JOY. FRIEND SEE ME, FRIEND JOY. DEEP JOY, TWO WAYS.</druid>

That's rather interesting. In the Life of a Draak, such a thing is rare indeed. You've been happy to encounter other beings... your prey... but they are seldom happy to encounter you. Even other Draak are fearsome threats which you have never been joyous to meet.

It sounds a little like "compassion", but more long-term, more focused, permanent.

Perhaps it does not exist, a fallacy of weak, social beings. Perhaps it is something else. It does not feel pleasant to think about.

The Artist bobs its head up and down repeatedly and makes excited bleating noises as it accepts your offering. You are now one step closer to helping it complete its greatest work.

The Artist eventually manages to communicate to you that it needs some time to put it to use, but before you leave, it informs you of the object's hidden properties, and you learn a few things of value.

Event: f004_3h

The Artist can barely contain its excitement, showing all of its teeth (which you have now learned is happiness, not aggression, to a No-Tail)  and making light "ha-ha" sounds as it Sings into your Mind.

It explains that its whole life it has been trying to create the ultimate medicine, something that would make any Body whole and free from impurities. It is certain to work on any living thing, restoring it to excellent health.

<druid>GIVE, WILL GIVE. WILL SHARE. YOU, ME. TOGETHER.</druid>

It shakes its head, clearing a bit of water from one of its eyes, and then slowly reaches out to place its alien paw gently on the tip of your nose.

<druid>FRIENDS?</druid>

You must be truthful.

Gently, you explain that the Draak must always stand alone; such was the price of your ascendancy. You will not chain yourself to another, even if the other wishes it.

You feel something strange in your chest and throat as the Artist removes its paw from you. It nods its head a few times.

<druid>NEXT SUN, FINISHED. FOR YOU. PROMISE, GRATITUDE. PEACE.</druid>

Once you are among the clouds on your way back to your Lair, you ponder. What was that feeling you had when you sang "no"? Something like...  disappointment. But while the No-Tail was surely disappointed, there wasn't any cause for you to be...

Was there?

==============================
Event: f004_41

The Artist's broken Body and that of its Blackburn companion are Quiet. The Void has at last taken both of them.

There is no sign of the Shorttail. It's not surprising; the Slideclaw People are far too intelligent to believe in loyalty.

Smelling something interesting, you turn the Body over to find the Artist's forepaw clamped tightly around a small clay container.

The rancid, oily scents still in the Air make it very clear what did this: other No-Tails.

Why? Did they want its territory? It would have gone Quiet very soon... could they not have waited?

But no... they are not here, and they relocated several things away from here...

The Treasure, then? But the Artist already wished to share it with all, and besides, they did not take it.

The Artist was deeply wise, and looked upon with honor by all of the local Talless. Why would they weaken themselves by Destroying someone who was their ally? The ally of all things?

The No-Tails...

==============================
Event: f004_41b

You begin by personally eating its heart. That is what the Draak do when they Destroy another Kin whose strength they respected.

Then, you used your fiery breath to reduce the Body to white ash.

Some, you buried several spans into the Earth.

Some, you mixed into the Waters of the distant Sea.

And the rest, you released high up in the Air, within a cloud.

The Four-Fold Return thus complete, you fell fast asleep on the sunning-rock outside your Lair.

That night, you had a True Dream of another time, another place.

You dreamed you saw a little Tailless-hatchling, wrapped all in furs and walking through the snow in the adults' footprints. Snowflakes tumble down lazily around it.

It reaches for a falling flake, which soon falls into its cupped forepaw. But when it peers closely, expecting to see a melting crystal latticework...

It is a single speck of white ash.

Event: f005

Is this the Riverwood?

That bastion of purity zealously guarded by one of your own? Where is its Kin-Lord's scent-boundary?

Certainly, things change during a Great Sleep of Turnings, but you never thought such a sharp transformation was possible. Why would Warden allow No-Tails to build a hivelet here?

Air betrays you with a shift of wind (it is fond of doing that) which brings your scent to the enslaved Clansingers who guard this place. They begin yelling frantically:

<dog1>Danger! Danger! Danger danger danger! Danger!</dog1>

<dog2>Help! Help! Help help help help help! Help! Help!</dog2>

You do not hear or smell any Tailless nearby, though a few Treetails dance up the Trees, startled by the racket.

You could just leave, but with no Tailless about, this might be a rare opportunity to enter one of their hivelets and learn something of them.

And who knows? There may be a Treasure inside.

<dog1>Danger danger! Danger danger danger!</dog1>

<dog2>Help! Heeeeelp helphelp! Help!</dog2>

Apparently Clansingers lose their Minds when they join the No-Tails.

This is very annoying.

==============================
Event: f005_1

It is rather dark in here, especially with your hindquarters blocking the entryway. Alas, this is as far in as you can squeeze yourself.

No matter. You can smell several interesting objects nearby, such as...

What is this?

It smells part Tree, part Beast. Yes... the curve is a Quiet bit of Elm, and the straight line smells like some kind of large Furbeast. A Hillback, perhaps, or a Plainsrunner.

It seems somewhat elastic.

That was... interesting. There is definitely something appealing about that sound. It also seems foreboding, for some reason, but that is part of its charm.

There seems to be quite a lot of dead, dry grass in here. Perhaps they are hoping (in vain) that the sweet smell will cover up their own stink.

Is this a Tailless hatchling?

No, it doesn't have a Rhythm, and isn't flesh inside.

Are they trying to make more No-Tails out of Grass? It might be possible, depending on what strange powers they have. A terrifying thought.

There is definitely something here. Another Tree-and-Beast object...

Beastskin, Great Grazer from the smell, and Tree-flesh. Are the Tailless trying to combine Trees and Beasts into something? It seems popular.

Perhaps there is something inside. You begin by lightly striking it with a claw...

That was unexpected. Your feathers are now quite puffed-out.

Mmmm....

Definitely hollow. Just an empty container.

……

Just one more time.

Enough, now.

Moving on...

Aha! Shinestone; the type that begins Sun-colored and ends Sea-colored. A lovely aroma. But you have never seen a shape like this in Nature.

Could the Tailless be able to change Shinestone? There is a small pit full of ashes and burnt Tree remnants, so perhaps they could melt it...

But how could they convince it to form such a symmetry once melted? It is frozen in a moving circle, like the shape of the Water element.

This reeks of Plainsrunner, but it is actually...

A secondskin. These are the slain Goodbeast pelts with which the Tailless cover up their Bodies.

Obviously, they do this because...

------------------------------
> They want to smell better.

------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f005_2

==============================
Event: f005_1b

How painful that would be! That would also explain why they keep Fire-spirits in the small central pit.

They should learn the fine art of Sun-bathing, or just go warmwards, like the Featherbeasts in season.

Of course... how could you not have smelled this Truth before? They are trying to shed their Otherness and become Beasts.

How could any being be ashamed of its own Body, its own Self? Why would they try to hide their flesh-truth, even from each other?

Is not pride in what one is ingrained in every Mind? If it were not so, a being might hate itself. That is a fate not to be wished on even the lowest Tiny Being.

==============================
Event: f005_2

It is difficult to know what to make of these discoveries. The objects are too well-used to be part of a Trove, if the Tailless even have those.

Still, perhaps they might have some value...

The Tailless... they return! All of that Mindless yelling from the Clansingers may have brought them back, or perhaps mere chance.

In any case, you still have a chance to escape. If you quickly leave empty-mouthed, you may escape unseen, but if you take these souvenirs, they will surely spot you as you go.

Of course, if the Tailless were simply Destroyed, that would not be an issue, would it?

You squeeze out, lightly bashing your head on the portal-frame, and are soon far away. Hopefully, they will not surmise that a Draak was here, or if they do, they will not know that it was you.

You have grown much stronger since your beginning; this would have meant certain death for you had you attempted such a Dance in Heartbone Valley.

Your victory fills you with pride. The Tailless can be Destroyed. You enjoy a filling meal on their remains.

You remove everything of interest from the hivelet and cover up all signs of your having been there. Perhaps they will believe it was a Great Lumberer that did this, if you are fortunate.

Your own Clansingers are more than happy to deal with these apostates.

After a brief verbal bout, which included such poisonous and vituperative insults that they make your feathers puff out, the Clansingers begin a vicious and bloody Dance of Destruction.

Though they could simply have run away, the Slaves fight with every fiber of their being, confident to the last breath that their New Gods would save them.

It was almost admirable, in its way, though the Dance was soured by the sharp red hatred both sides had for each other.

The recalcitrant Beasts are stunned as you calmly pass them by. It never occurred to them that you might be so powerful and confident that you would find them unworthy of further attention.

It feels right, though, as you do so. You cannot force other Beasts to see as you see, or understand the greater reality as you understand.

Event: f006

Heading coldwards from the hivelet you discovered on the edge of the Riverwood, you are soon greeted by a remarkable sight (and smell).

Furbeasts. Large furbeasts. Many, many, many large furbeasts.

It seems as though every Great Grazer and Slave Surefoot on blessed Earth has gathered here to feed. The scent of them (and their prodigious waste) carries across the territory.

A small group of Slave Clansingers on a nearby hill growl a curse and run, no doubt to raise their Tailless masters against you.

Of course, the grazing Furbeasts are fearful. A brave Surefoot Birther asks you cautiously:

<sheep>Have you come to hunt, great Draak-Kin?</sheep>

The masses breathe a collective, Grass-scented sigh of relief at the news. Some go back to their continuous Destruction of greenery, but others aim their eyes and ears towards you, curious to know what would bring a mighty Draak to their gathering if not the scent of flesh.

Two Tribes seem to be coexisting here: the Great Grazers and the Slave Surefoots. The earth-shaking Grazers were once fit and muscular, but now they resemble ambulatory slabs of meat. Their Givers' milk-parts seem swollen.

The Surefoots, with their strong legs and feet of Stone, once plied the high regions. These ones are shaggier than their free brethren, their Givers have smaller head-weapons, and their Birthers have none.

Indeed, there are few Givers here at all, of either People. The vast majority seem to be Birthers and their children.

One of the rare Givers, sporting a strip of what smells like Grazer-skin about its neck, answers:

<sheep>Now, the lowlands belong to us. There is more delicious Green here than we could ever consume.</sheep>

<sheep>When I was a child, there were so few in my Clan that I sometimes felt lonely. Now, there are more of us than there are Stars in the Great Above. I could not even hope to know all of their scents, and this is only one Clan of my Tribe, and one Tribe of my People.</sheep>

<sheep>All of this is the fruit of one great discovery: Trust.</sheep>

<sheep>This is the name we have given to what we have learned. The New Gods will grant us wealth and increase our People so long as we do not Doubt. Doubt opens the path to Fear, and Fear to Violence and Exile.</sheep>

<sheep>So we Trust. Our Birthers sing gentle Songs of the New Gods' greatness to the children, and our Givers lower their proud heads in their presence. Indeed, we hardly need our head-weapons at all. Such things are relics of our past.</sheep>

A Surefoot Birther adds:

<sheep>Sometimes we wonder where our young Givers have gone, why we never smell them again. Some say they go to Clans who need more Givers.</sheep>

The Slave Clansingers are returning with their flat-faced Masters.

There are many of them. Remaining here would probably be unwise.

Fortunately, the hillside makes for an easy takeoff: a few downhill leaps and bounds and the wind catches your wings. Soon, the slave-Beasts are just small dots against the Grass-blanket.

Another Sun, if you wish, you may return here to hunt. For now, you must be content with having learned more about the once-Goodbeasts who now live under the shadow of the Tailless.

They worship and adore the No-Tails who breed and harvest them like Plants, who put up Walls around them, who strike them and take away their young Givers forever...

Are such Beasts mad, or is this the beginning of a terrible new sanity?

Event: f007

Two Storms.

One in the Great Above, another below. Neither yet begun, but both inevitable.

You do not need to understand the yelpings of these Tailless Givers to know what is going on. Though they all look and smell the same to you, the group on the left must represent the local Hive due to their positioning, making the group on the right foreign invaders.

It probably isn't a full-on territorial challenge, like those the Draak issue; surely more would be fighting if everything were at stake. Still, it must be a serious matter if they would do the Dance of Destruction in the Rain on just two thin legs.

As you look on from just inside the cover of the Great Green, they begin casting things at each other, stones and fanged sticks from items of Grazer-skin and dead Tree, trying to harm their enemies without directly risking their own Bodies.

When this fails to resolve the situation, some shinestone-clad Warriors gripping long, heavy-looking false-talons and fangs charge their enemies, and a practical Jamboree of Destruction begins.

The Rain makes it difficult to see and smell; only your hearing can be relied upon. The yelps you hear are often pained, and several of the Dancers now lie on the ground, most still moving, a few not.

None of this is your affair, but there may be an opportunity here for a brave or cunning Draak...

Event: f007a

The Dance suddenly gutters like a dying flame as you emerge from hiding, crown-feathers erect, tail lashing back and forth. The Tailless stare, their bloodlust wavering, confused by your beauty and majesty.

Turning toward the local group, you release a deep blast of flame in their direction and sing a roaring song at them:

<player>I AM YOUR END! BURN TO ASHES, AND BE SWALLOWED BY THE VOID!</player>

If you were concerned that they might not understand your mighty voice, there was no need to worry. Your taking their opponents' side has drained all hope of victory.

Any who waver are put to mad flight by your charging at them. Their enemies are elated, hooting excitedly and chasing after the fleeing Warriors. Though they clearly regard your assistance as a wonder, they are in no mood to question it, stampeding past you.

Soon, you are alone but for the dead and the dying left behind in the rush. Thanks to your intervention, the local No-Tails have suffered a crushing defeat this Sun (and you did not even need to Dance!).

You take a few moments to relieve those lying Silently in Rain and Essence of any shiny possessions. By the time Warriors return to help the wounded or deal with the slain, you are gone.

Event: f007c

At times, you are astonished by the bravery of these Tailless Dancers of Destruction, and at other times by their cowardice. Sometimes individuals refuse to yield despite grave, Life-threatening wounds, and sometimes they scramble for safety though yet unhurt.

The young and overeager are the first to fall. The older ones last much longer despite their weaker limbs, suggesting that Dances like this are not uncommon in the life of a No-Tail. Those who have endured have learned much battle-wisdom.

It is not an uncommon tactic, even among Beasts; risk the Givers, protect the Birthers, and let the survivors breed, strengthening the next generation. What seems cruel is that some of these young Givers are not even given the chance to prove themselves, felled by projectiles from afar or cut down from behind by a Dancer they never even saw.

Eventually, one side gains momentum and drives the others from the field, who flee. Most of the winning side chases after them in pursuit, briefly leaving the field bare but for the slain and the seriously wounded.

This was the moment you were waiting for. The Rain is coming down harder now, making vision unclear, but your nose leads you to one fallen Dancer after another.

But most are still Rhythmic, some unconscious, some groaning in pain. What shall you do with them?

It is not a difficult thing. Even the conscious ones are mostly paralyzed by Pain. Any Goodbeast would put up more of a fight, even with such wounds... are the No-Tails just weak, or is their experience of Pain different from that of other beings?

At any rate, they are easy meals. You eat rather well.

==============================
Event: f007cab

A very interesting scent suddenly makes your tail grow rigid: Treasure!

Following your nose, you come upon an older Warrior, bloodied and unconscious. About its neck is an object made of that precious shinestone known as Gold, which glows like Sun and never rusts or fades.

A younger Tailless with a very similar scent is attempting to drag the heavy Body to safety. When you draw near, it slowly and gently places its Elder on the ground and turns to face you, death-pole clutched tightly in its forelegs.

It is babbling something at you, but you cannot understand. It reeks of fear and a little of its own red Essence. It must have been slightly wounded in the Dance.

Why in Earth's name is it standing between you and what you obviously want? What could it have to gain by being Destroyed here? It cannot possibly hold the Life of that older Giver as more precious than its own.

The Gold gleams wetly. The young Tailless' paws are shaking slightly, but its feet are firmly planted. A little Essence drips from a wound on its flank.

In the future, if asked, you would have difficulty explaining why you left without the Treasure. You were certainly not afraid of one young, already-battered Tailless Warrior, though some will think that you were.

There was something stopping you, however. A... scent, if you could call it that, coming from the youngling. A strange blue Fire, of an invisible kind.

To face Death Itself, for such you are to them, in place of another. Madness beyond madness. Stupidity most extreme. But also... somehow...

Only you can say whether it was simple fascination or admiration which moved you to leave those two alone, but you did so. Afterwards, you felt something strange stirring within your mighty feathered breast, something which you could not name.

Why are you so glad, so content, to have lost a Treasure? Why do you feel that you have somehow gained by letting it go?

==============================
Event: f008

Sun bleeds onto the darkening hills. You are about to take flight for home when you catch the scent of several No-Tails.

Curious, you follow the trail to discover a modest troop, including a pair of armed Warriors, carrying a long, wrapped object up a hill.

When near the summit, they lay the bundle down and unwrap it to reveal the Quiet Body of one of their own kind. It seems to have been recently Destroyed; the scent of decay is not yet strong.

As you watch, the No-Tails lower the empty Body into a long hole in the ground, carefully, very carefully, as though it is merely asleep and they do not wish to wake it.

Why be so gentle with an empty Body? It does not feel pain, being devoid of Mind. And why put it inside Earth? It is a waste of perfectly good flesh to bury it where none can consume it.

Even more shockingly, they then proceed to put more things into the hole: glittering stones, pieces of Amber cunningly strung together, a figurine of what looks like a Lumberer out of bone, even one of the shinestone false-fangs which they use as weapons.

Sometimes they murmur to one another in low tones or lightly hold each other close. A few are emitting muffled cries rhythmically while emitting salt-Water from their eyes. Others rush to touch and whisper to such ones, who gradually become calm, but the warm, salty drops continue to fall.

As the setward glow dwindles, they gather together, grasping each other's paws, and then lift their voices in Song. It is...

... is this a True Song? It evokes something within you, a feeling of despair, as though Sun has perished forever, and will never return...

But also hope, as though the light will somehow come again, if only from within.

You have heard many-voiced Songs before... the Clansingers, for example, all sing together, but each one is careful to make a different sound from all the others, to clash, showing diversity and strength in numbers.

This Tailless Song, however, takes all of the voices and makes them One. It is as though they are all briefly becoming the very same being, feeling the same emotions.

They all seem to know just which tone comes next, and how long each should be. It is deeply intentional and fixed, yet also flowing and emotive.

When finished, they fill up the hole together, enclosing everything, Body and Treasures, in the Great Mother's flesh. They stack a few broad, flat Stones together atop the mound and depart one by one, leaving the two Warriors to stand amidst the trampled Grass and drying tears.

You have never heard of anything like this. When any Goodbeast dies, its kin simply leave it, or even consume it. A Body without a Rhythm is just a shell, devoid of Life forevermore.

But these No-Tails... they are different. They made a special place in Earth for their Quiet, Sang to its deaf ears, put gifts into its cold paws.

Why would they put such valuable things under Earth, never to retrieve them? The only explanation would be that they believe that the Quiet can still appreciate and use such gifts, but they cannot. Why waste that which would be of much greater use to the living?

But most mysteriously, all of the living Tailless gathered here were in pain. Deep pain. You could hear it in their Song, in their cries, in their very breathing. Yet they were all uninjured.

What was this phantom pain? Whence this grey-blue burden which seemed to be afflicting all of them?

The demise of a fellow Kin leads to nothing but a rush to claim its land and its Trove. It is an opportunity for the living.

Why trade Happiness and Gain for Sorrow and Loss? It seems mad.

Something is tickling at your Mind...

You shake your head to clear it. An opportunity lies before you.

Many valuables are buried under this mound of Earth. Also, the Body is still fresh enough to eat.

It is guarded, though. What will you do?

With the guardians Destroyed, unEarthing that which was buried is a simple task.

You find an impressive number of shiny things and Tailless craftworks, and between the fallen Warriors and the Body under the ground, you have had a filling meal.

The foolishness of the No-Tails has become your gain. They never should have given up their possessions for the sake of one who was already gone.

But even before they threw all of these shiny things into the hole, they acted as though they had already lost something far more precious...

...as though they had forever lost a very great Treasure.

Could it be...?

You come up with a plan to cause a distraction nearby and then raid the mound while they are investigating.

You smash a few dead Trees, burn a Shrub and then circle around the bottom of the hill.

Ah, yes. The mound is unguarded, now. You start digging...

Only to be surprised by the Warriors attacking you from separate directions! They must have seen through your ruse, hidden themselves downwind and approached with greater stealth than you thought them capable of.

How irritatingly clever, to make your trap into a counter-trap. Indeed, the Tailless must never be underestimated.

You are trapped now, and cannot flee. Hopefully, you are strong enough to survive this Dance of Destruction.

Well, that was decidedly unpleasant.

You manage to dig up some shiny things from the mound, but you smell other No-Tails on the breeze, and must leave before finding everything, nor is there time for a meal.

At least you have learned more about the Tailless. You will not make the mistake of underestimating them again.

==============================
Event: f008bs

You know enough about these Other-seed to understand that a simple distraction is unlikely to work. Making some noise and then attempting to outmaneuver them could backfire.

Instead, you decide to use their complex Minds against them. Beginning by using your Mind-song to cause them to see sigils vague and terrifying, you then begin to use your Mindscream ability, gently at first and then more powerfully.

As their fear grows, they chatter to each other, but cannot locate the source of their torment. They begin to see enemies in every dark shadow, every void-colored corner of Night.

Believing themselves to be beset by some formless, spiritual foe, they realize that their shinestone weapons are worthless and finally flee in terror.

On to pillage! It takes some time, but after quite a bit of burrowing you are fairly certain you have stripped this mound of anything valuable, besides the meat, of course.

Consume the Body here as well?

Seasoned with the soil and slightly ripened, the Tailless Body is delicious.

Consuming it feels right. The Quiet are not to be stored away under the ground... they are to be fuel for the Living. Anything else would be wasteful.

The Tailless will probably not see it that way, however, and with the corpse devoured they will know that it was not a spirit or one of their own kind who did this.

Though you have gained much this evening, you struggle to make sense of it during your home-flight.

They gave precious things to a still Body, even sang to it and guarded it. Why do all these things for a Mind-less husk?

And the sorrow, the pain... Why?

In fact, the entire affair smells like joy. The air is filled with many voices, many songs.

If even half this many Kin came to your land for any reason, you would be out of your Mind. Why do they delight in being surrounded by so many competitors, so many possible threats?

If you just fly away now, you will surely be seen. Perhaps there is a way to avoid discovery, however.

<player>Behold, I am the crowning glory of Earth and Sun. I bring sacred Destruction to all.</player>

<player>You therefore wish to be silent, and to depart in peace. It is the only path to Life for you and those you believe you protect.</player>

<player>Silence. Fear. Retreat. Silence. Fear. Retreat.</player>

The power of your Song and the swaying motion of your Body render the Clansinger helpless. At the last, it believes your Song, and withdraws, tail tucked low under its Body.

Joined at the paws, the Tailless are prancing in a circle around a dead Tree festooned with lesser plants and twisted into elemental shapes.

Their feet move nimbly, crossing over each other at times. You never would have believed it if another Kin told you that the No-Tails could move their Bodies like this.

They are also singing, their Song rising in unison, following a set sequence, as does their Dance.

Obviously, they are skilled in memory and communication if they are able to plan and execute such complex Dances and Songs together. The true question:

Why are they doing this at all?

It seems not to be leading to Destruction, Creation or Treasure. Why exert oneself if for none of those?

As you continue to observe, you gradually realize that there is a strange sort of Creation occurring here. Their Essences are entangling, Minds joining paths. They have even formed one large Body, in a way.

They are joining together, but not to Create new Life. It is physically shallower and yet deeper than that.

Quite a few objects are being displayed by a black-maned No-Tail on some kind of soft non-skin.

The No-Tail barks at passers-by, who sometimes turn aside to pick up, point to or sing over the objects in question.

None of the things on display are found in Nature. All seem to have been warped into shapes functional, decorative or just plain odd from shinestone, Tree-flesh and Beast-parts.

Occasionally, the displayer receives something... a Beast-skin, perhaps, or a shinestone ornament... and then gives one of the objects in exchange. Both parties seem quite pleased, though only one of them should be. After all, there is no such thing as a perfect exchange.

A Clansinger slave looks on. It is protective of its master (the black-maned one) but is also quite happy, and not at all frightened at the presence of so many Tailless. Occasionally, the master reaches over and strokes the slave's ears, or scratches its back lightly.

Much of the scene is alarming... Beast-skins and carved bones serving as mere decoration, unequal exchanges under a pretense of mutual gain, enslavement of Goodbeasts...

And yet all of them, even the Clansinger, smell quite content. Happy, even. The gestures of pleasure and encouragement seem genuine. They thrive amidst the Song-addled Air and the Body-scents of strangers.

It is as though they have all learned to love Chaos.

A wizened Birther croons to a small brood of hatchlings who have gathered on the Grass.

It demonstrates how to entangle the torn-off reproductive organs of Plants into simple shapes, with which the hatchlings adorn their Bodies.

Some of the hatchlings are far more skilled than others at the task. One in particular seems to lack the necessary coordination or mental acuity (or perhaps both). You expect it to be struck or at least shamed for its ineptitude...

But shockingly, the elder does not punish it. Instead, it puts the hatchling in its lap and shows it the process yet again, more slowly and with even more care and encouragement.

When the hatchling finally succeeds, they both celebrate.

As a lone hunter, you are no great expert in the behavior of social animals, but in your observations of those among Beastkind, there is little pity or patience for laggards.

Underperforming hatchlings must be motivated by pain, and if that fails, abandoned or Consumed. Otherwise, they may become a burden to their People.

But from what you just saw, you are certain that this particular elder, at least, would never abandon a hatchling. Not ever.

You can smell it on her soul.

WHOCK. CRACK. CLACK.

So this is how the Tailless learn to fight with not-their-Bodies.

Shining with sweat (a spicy ooze which forms on overheated Tailless), these moderately-sized flatfaces strike at each other with stripped Tree limbs.

They seem to be enjoying the activity immensely, emitting excited yelps and the occasional "ha-ha-ha" sound.

They use the weapons for both attack and defense. Sometimes, they knock an incoming blow aside and follow up with an attack of their own while their opponent is off balance. Clever.

By doing the Dance of Destruction with not-their-Bodies, they are extending their reach and leverage.

Their faces and vulnerable parts are kept safely out of the way, the dead weapons receiving the vast majority of the punishment.

You wonder what that is like, not using one's face as one's primary weapon. Though the utility of this can't be disputed, the Dance of Destruction is sacred, and this feels like cheating.

When one of them scores a blow, you expect the loser to be cross, but instead victories and defeats both seem only to increase their respect for each other.

This Dance of Destruction is actually Creating strong bonds between them.

Event: f009e

A physically mature but still young Giver and Birther are standing very close, singing to each other softly.

The Birther's hands are gently touching the Giver's arms, perhaps attempting to judge its strength. The Giver is paying special attention to the Birther's chest, for some reason.

You can smell their arousal from here. Both of their Bodies are practically screaming to become one, to do the Dance of Creation.

You wonder why they don't just do it. Come to think of it, you wonder why none of these Tailless are mating, happy and well-fed as they are. Most of the Birthers smell like they are in season.

There must be some kind of Tradition, some kind of Lesser Law, forbidding them from performing the Dance of Creation, at least at the moment. You cannot imagine why; such urges come from pure Nature, and echo Earth's Dance with Sun. Could any form of Life be ashamed of how it was Created?

Somehow, though, despite a certain level of obvious physical need, there is more to what is going on between the young Giver and the young Birther.

More than each other's Bodies, they are lost in each other's eyes. It is as though they find each other's Minds most attractive.

As you observe, each places a circle of flowers on its partner's head. In such a way, they bless the other and give them power. Their very spirits are touching.

The sheer will of the Tailless, denying their own sacred instincts despite being in season, is impressive, but even more so is the way this pair, and others here, are forming bonds which go deeper than the Body, deeper than the Mind.

Could even the eternal Void sunder such bonds between Birther and Giver?

==============================
Event: f010

Quite a few scent-trails lead to this place, which is close to the Tailless Hive but far enough that you cannot smell it from here.

The Tailless have brought Stone and Tree-flesh together to form the sacred Water-sign. It is actually impressive... how did they move such huge Stones? Even you may not have been able to manage it.

No matter. Here, inside the ring, they have gathered. You know that Tailless eyesight is poor when Sun is gone, so you will be safe here, in the outer dark.

You crane your neck, looking up and over the stones to observe. Many adult Tailless have gathered, more than you have claws, though not more than you have teeth.

They are led by one whose whole Body is covered in a moon-white secondskin and who seems to be treated with deference. It must be an Elder... it has more face-fur than the others, as well.

It barks a few notes of babble-song and the others all fall silent and still. For a moment, nothing can be heard but the plaintive cries of the slave Surefoot in the center.

<sheep><color 38761d>This is uncomfortable! Please change my situation!</color></sheep>

The Tailless Elder ignores its pleas, and begins to raise its voice in song, striking the same notes in the same sequence over and over.

The others join in. It is a unity of Number and Sound, bringing them all together in Mind, and perhaps in Essence.

After a time, the Elder places its forepaw on the Surefoot's horned head, murmuring something. The tone is gentle; a blessing, perhaps.

<sheep><color 38761d>Good, yes! Unbind me!</color></sheep>

Then, the Elder turns its attention skyward. It begins to chatter and yelp at the Stars above. Is it singing to them?

No... it seems to be trying to communicate with something beyond the Stars.

Something above, something higher than the Void.

The elder's blabbering grows more intense, more high and wild, and as it makes noise it slowly brings a sharp piece of shinestone to the Surefoot's throat.

<sheep><color 38761d>What is that for? I don't need that! I need...</color></sheep>

Destruction.

With great intention, the Elder plunges the shard into the Surefoot's Body again and again, until the shard and its paws are slick and red.

It walks about to each of the other Tailless, marking their brows with a little of the Beast's dark Essence. They receive this mark with eyes closed, as if savoring the experience.

Then, seemingly without cause, the wood and the Surefoot's Body catch Fire.

The others lower themselves before the triumphant Elder, or perhaps before the Fire or whatever caused it.

While the Surefoot's empty Body burns to ashes, the singing resumes, and all seem to be in a state of ecstasy.

The Elder often gestures upward, and is barking in an authoritarian yet grateful way... a strange contrast.

There is joy, much joy, and a savage fulfillment. This sight, these sounds, these smells... they are quite dissonant, especially all together, but the Tailless obviously rejoice in them.

Eventually, the Elder gives a final gesture of its paws and a series of locutions. The Tailless slowly leave, one by one.

They seem somehow changed, as though they were hungry but now have had a good meal. This entire act...

It fed them, somehow.

When all are gone and the Fire has eaten itself into nothing again, the Elder cleans up the remains.

A young Tailless emerges from inside the central stone, carrying the blackened remains of a branch, and the two sing to each other for a while.

So that is what caused the Fire... there was a Tailless hidden inside the hollow central stone who lit the blaze at some kind of signal, unknown to all but the Elder. The two clearly planned this in advance.

And then, they are gone. Night reclaims all.

A swarm of questions buzz within your Mind...

Why the Surefoot? Why bring it all the way here, so far from its home-vale, just to Destroy it and burn it to nothing?

------------------------------
> To torment it. They must enjoy its suffering.
  Go to: f010a

==============================
Event: f010_1

And why did their own Elder deceive them? It presented the Fire as a causeless marvel, but it was no more than a trick achieved by a hidden accomplice.

It must have planned this because...

------------------------------
> The Elder would personally gain from this.
  Go to: f010_1a
> The Elder was testing their wits.
  Go to: f010_1b
> The Elder was fulfilling their collective desire.
  Go to: f010_1c

==============================
Event: f010_1a

Indeed, others would think it powerful if able to summon Fire itself, like a Draak. And who would not wish to be a Draak-Kin?

And they all did seem quite pleased with the Elder's performance. Perhaps this entire Song and Dance was simply self-aggrandizement after all. It would not be pointless, for a social Being.

But... something does not taste right about that. The Elder continually gestured up, to Beyond-the-Stars, not to itself. Before, after, and during, it was much more concerned with... whatever Else.

And the Tailless did not give the Elder anything, Dance with it, or even remain in its presence for long afterwards. If the Elder itself had been the point of all of that...

But then... why?



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f010_2

==============================
Event: f010_1b

Mmmm. That would be an excellent test. If that is so, then they certainly failed.

But... the Elder did not seem disappointed in that failure, nor joyous, as though it could now do something because the others had proven themselves sufficiently stupid.

A learning opportunity, then? A social Being would benefit by testing others of its kind and making them stronger...

But no. If it were a learning opportunity, it would have revealed the trick and taught them at the last. Possibly berated them for their lack of perception.

Instead, the Elder seemed quietly content.

But then... why?



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f010_2

==============================
Event: f010_1c

That... tastes right. You smelled relief coming from most of them in that moment.

A strange thing to smell when something bursts unexpectedly into a blaze, but it was so.

They seemed to want something un-natural to occur, something beyond their understanding. But why would they want that?

What kind of Being wants to believe that it is in the presence of the unknown?



------------------------------

  Go to: f010_2

==============================
Event: f010_2

Where ends this twisted path?

The Destruction of the Surefoot, the deception, the songs. They did so many things, and with such intentional arrangement.

They were focused on something which was above them, but also within them.

<italic>Above</italic>, yet <italic>within</italic>...

<color 674ea7><italic>Above</color><color 683e9a>,</italic></color>, yet <color ffd966><italic>within</color></italic>...

They came from <color 9900ff><bold>above</color></bold>...

And left their seed...

<color ffd966><italic>Within</color></italic> their legacy...

<color cc0000>THE OTHERS.</color>

The Others were the focus of this entire series of actions.

The Tailless were trying to communicate with the Others, who made their kind.

The Surefoot must have been a gift for them, and they interpreted the Fire to mean that the gift was accepted.

And what did the Tailless desire in exchange? Power? Wisdom? Treasure?

Perhaps, a little. But the deep satisfaction you smelled within them is one you have encountered before.

It was the smell of a small, lost youngling, finally reunited with its Creator. Safe.

Peaceful.

Wringing Peace out of Violence and Fire. When you put it that way, it does not sound so strange. The Draak solve many problems with such tools.

And yet it is entirely different, because they are yearning for something completely outside of their own ability to attain.

Their satisfaction will not last. The Others were not truly here, did not truly provide them with anything.

How desperate, how deeply in pain, the Tailless must be for them to need this.

To need to believe that they are communicating with the Others who gave them these spindly, naked Bodies and oversharp Minds.

They are blind to the deeper Music of Earth and Sun, and it is not their fault. They cannot even see the Spirit-Lines which color Truth into Reality.

This World must look so empty to their eyes. Could they ever truly love Her?

If they could, would they cease being Other-seed, and finally become true Goodbeasts? Or would it Destroy them?

You have never pitied anything so much as you do the Tailless in this moment, as they grope scent-blind through the dark towards their Hive, believing in a cruelkind lie.

It was uncomfortable for a very long time, and it trusted that they would rescue it to the end. Perhaps they relish pain and betrayal...

But no... if that were true, they could have drawn out its end much, much longer. Even Slideclaws torture prey more skillfully than that.

When the time came for it to be Destroyed, it was over in an instant, and though confused, it did not really suffer. A single, expert slash to the throat. Quite merciful, really.

But then... why?



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f010_1

==============================
Event: f010b

Yes, perhaps that is it. The Elder seemed to be blessing it, and marked the others with a bit of its Essence.

But at the same time... why Destroy what one would honor, without even Consuming it?

If it really were a special Surefoot, why not let it continue to exist? It was not old, and could have survived for a few more Turnings at least.

And they have many, many Surefoots as slaves; this one did not seem to differ in any way from others.

This activity was clearly special, but it seemed as though any Surefoot would do.

But then... why?



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f010_1

==============================
Event: f010c

Wait... what? Where did that thought even come from? How can anything be sent beyond the Stars?

And yet, the more you think about it, the more that tastes true. They were fixated on the Beyond both before and after the act, and the smoke rising from it...

That's it! The smoke! They believed that they were sending it to the Beyond through the rising smoke!

...which is pure idiocy. Its Essence clearly dissipated into nothing, just as with everything else. The Tailless must not be able to sense the Spirit-Colors which you can.

And besides, smoke does not rise forever. You have flown high enough to know that it does not even reach the Clouds, much less the Void, much, much less whatever is beyond the Void.

But every small gesture and sound made by the Elder and the group resonates with that idea. Somehow, you are fairly sure that is what they were trying to do.

You could even see it from the lower sky. It broods there, like a Creator on its egg.

This sprawling Lair which the No-Tails have crafted out of Tree-flesh is the crowning glory of the Hive. Many times, you have seen them entering and leaving.

As the only Lair large enough for you to fully enter, it represents a rare opportunity for you to gain knowledge and perhaps Treasure.

Ordinarily, you would not be able to get close without stirring up a swarm of defenders, but you have been watching, waiting.

This Sun, nearly all of the Tailless have left and gone elsewhere, visiting a setward ring of Stones as they do each new Moon. Their Hive-cells stand empty.

You were hoping that there would be no defenders remaining, but it seems as though two Tailless and a slave Clansinger remain, probably to guard the Hive's Treasure.

How will you deal with the guardians?

==============================
Event: f011_1

Normally, the Tailless use the skins of Goodbeasts to cover the entrances of their Hive-cells, but this one features large flaps of Tree-flesh instead. Shinestone and Beast-horn adorn the barrier.

Pushing at it with your snout makes it bend inward a little, showing that it is weaker than the surrounding mass. It will not break easily, but it will break.

On the other paw, the Tailless must have a way to get past without damaging it. Perhaps you could deduce their method.

What will you do?

------------------------------

==============================
Event: f011_1a

You back away and charge the barriers, throwing your full weight against them.

Your twin opponents shudder and groan, but do not yield. Impertinent things.

Again and again you launch yourself at them. It takes a great amount of energy, and also a light toll on your Body.

One failed attempt in particular leaves your skull ringing with pain... if only you had huge horns like a Grazer...

But you faintly hear something crunching just inside. Hopefully, it is whatever is blocking these accursed slabs.

At last! It seems that they had placed a smaller piece of Tree-flesh behind the main ones which was preventing them from opening.

That was painful and tiring, but now, at last, you will be able to enter the Long-Lair. What Treasure awaits?



------------------------------

  Go to: f011_2

==============================
Event: f011_1bf

You sniff all around the flaps, but with the exception of the sweet smell of shinestone mingling with the morbid smell of murdered Trees, this reveals nothing.

If pushing will not open it, perhaps pulling will? You grasp one of the Woodstrider headweapons in your jaws and yank as hard as you can...

But that doesn't seem to have done anything but break the thing. Neither pushing nor pulling works, apparently.

You now have but one choice.



------------------------------

  Go to: f011_1

==============================
Event: f011_1bs

You conduct a full investigation of the twin slabs of dead Tree. You quickly discover that neither pushing nor pulling on them will work.

There is a very narrow gap, keen as a tooth, between them, and you can just barely make out something on the other side barring the portal-flaps.

That must be what is preventing them from moving, but the space is very thin.

Carefully, you insert a single long, thin claw into the gap and move it upwards. You feel it catch on the bar, and then, with a little effort, you lift it up and away.

Nothing now stands between you and that which the No-Tails value most.

A thousand years of dreams.

A thousand years of dreams could not contain this impossibility which now holds you in its warm, sharp jaws.

It is Music, swooping upward and downward, from side to side, under and over and around itself without ever making a sound.

It is Music, the soft deep reality upon which all hard things float, stripped of its veil and splashed across the outer dimensions.

It is Music, bold magic of the Stars meeting the Cloud-shrouded Night of the Mind.

Powerful emotions rise within you, as when you scent prey or behold Sun's beautiful demise over the Sea.

You can taste the very Essence of several Creators in the patterns, the curves, the lines. Here, in this place, the Tailless have opened their deepest selves to each other. The intimacy of the act leaves you almost breathless.

It is an altogether new kind of Creation, one which requires neither maturity nor might, but the tender courage to draw forth one's own soul and let it stand naked before others. How do they dare...?

Do they not know that one's innermost self must never be shared? Do they not understand the power it would give others?

Or is this, at last, the secret of their alien Minds, the key to their power?

A new term is needed for what they have done here. Because they have reached into their Hearts and brought out half, you decide to name it ART.

What now is your will?

These seem to be depictions of the Essence of the Great Four.

They flow up-to-down, down-to-up, closing a circle beyond the Lair somewhere outside of existence.

As the Elements form the supports of reality, these carven representations support this large structure. The utility is both physical and spiritual.

Powerful Music, indeed. Air, Water, Fire and Earth must extend far beyond Earth and Sun's domain into other Worlds.

It must be, or the Other-Seed would not be able to understand them so well after such a brief time spent here.

These patterns are Water-shaped, but immutable like Earth, and with Air- and Fire-shades dancing within.

Four in one. Ingenious.

There does not seem to be any given pattern to the changes between them, at least that you can deduce.

Each is its own Beast, full of meaning and quiet Life.

Would it be possible for you to Create something like this? It seems lewd, to smear one's inmost Essence out like this.

It is indisputably brave of them to try.

  Go to: f011_2

==============================
Event: f011_2c

Multifarious Reality has been immortalized here.

Stern-looking Clansingers hunt noble Woodstriders across Time itself, an endless Dance of Destruction.

Outside of this Lair, No-Tails seem to act without any regard to the sovereignty of the Goodbeasts who have dwelt here for Turnings beyond count. It would be easy to assume that they feel no respect for any People but their own.

But by such Art as this, you may be certain: the Tailless do find Sun and Earth's native children beautiful, in their own way.

But if this is so, why do they murder the Trees and chip away at the Green, sub-Mother of so many Tribes?

Do they immortalize them here because they feel the Music in the Essences of the Clansingers and the Woodstriders, or only because they wish them to be abundant for the harvest of their flesh, their skins?

It is Love they feel for these Goodbeasts, or only rapacious Lust? Too much of their Essence has been poured into this for it to be merely the latter, and yet their other actions belie the former.

And what are these? Are these how they see themselves?

Merging of Beast elements with Other-seed... do they wish to become Goodbeasts, after all?

Or are these depictions of the Others who Created them? Could this be yet one more technique by which they attempt to gain their favor, their attention?

No... this does not carry the scent of utility. They are not trying to do any one thing by this.

Instead, they are trying to express something, to rotate it laterally in relation to concrete existence. Bending it.

Trying to look at it from a direction heretofore unknown, unsung, perhaps.

Whatever the intent, it is difficult to look away. Everywhere your Mind rests, a new, small secret seems to lie half-buried behind the forms.

There cannot possibly be anything else in all the endless Onesong exactly like this Lair. If only it would fit inside your mouth.

Event: f011_2e

Wise were you indeed to come here. You have seen the secret soul of the Seed of the Others.

You turn to leave...

It was right behind you the whole time, gazing at you with dead amber eyes.

So this is what remains of the guardian of the Riverwood. By the smell of it, it was Silenced four, perhaps five Turnings ago.

Did they honor it with a true Dance of Destruction? Or was it tricked, trapped, poisoned? Did it end Life in confusion?

It was known to have believed the Tailless to be nothing more than annoying vermin, easily quashed.

Now, each time they leave this place, the No-Tails gaze upon its Quiet head. Do they feel pride at having Destroyed such an advanced Being? Hatred for your People? Is it beautiful to them, or ugly?

They seem to have attempted to augment it, replacing the eyes with calcified Tree-essence and holding it all together with gut-string.

It makes it look all the more violated and unnatural. They are not even allowing it to return to the Mother and finish the Great Circle.

What will you do?

The guardian's Essence is long gone. What happens to a part of its empty shell is of no concern to you, and besides, interfering may enrage them.

You had already begun to suspect its demise. The true question is this: why did no other Kin move in to take over stewardship of the territory?

Are the Tailless so great a threat that other Kin are not now powerful enough, bold enough, to assert their claims? Never before have you heard of such a thing. Kin are permitted to fear only each other.

As you depart, you reflect on how greatly the Way of this World seems to be changing. You have beheld the power of the No-Tails directly this Sun, and understand them far more deeply.

Their soft exteriors hide a power beautiful and dread, mysterious and brutal, like Nature itself turned sideways...

Like the fall of Night...

The Tailless will be wrathful to lose a symbol of their own power such as the head of a Kin. They may seek revenge...

But you will not allow one of your own beautiful People to be divorced from the Way of Life with this false immortality.

Seizing the head in your jaws, you abscond with it. Taking flight, you travel for a short while before dropping it into a deeper part of the Shallow River, near the guardian's old home.

The Water and silt will help it find the dissolution it deserves. Soon, nothing will remain but the bone, and then nothing at all, as it was meant to be.

To attempt to preserve a Body against the will of Time is blasphemy. The Void is worthy to receive all.

You had already begun to suspect the demise of your fellow Kin. Not having encountered it alive yet was evidence enough.

The true question is this: why did no other Kin move in to take over stewardship of the territory?

Are the Tailless so great a threat that other Kin are not now powerful enough, bold enough, to assert their claims? Never before have you heard of such a thing. Kin are permitted to fear only each other.

The sky is rapidly darkening, leaving the Tailless with only its poor ears and poorer nose to sense you.

You settle in, holding your Body low and hidden, waiting for an opportunity. You wait a very long time.

You wait...

And wait...

And wait...

<dog1>HELP! HERE! HELP! INTRUDER! DRAAK! HELP!</dog1>

You are snapped out of a sleep you didn't know you had fallen into by the Song of the Clansinger slave. Its masters, alerted by the sound, are charging at you, brandishing falsefangs at the ends of branches.

It seems that the Clansinger managed to find your scent while you were resting. The Dance begins!

You settle in, waiting patiently. It seems a very, very long time has passed and nothing has changed. It would be tempting just to move in...

But you are wise indeed in the ways of Earth, and are able to silence the inner voices of haste and overconfidence while also fighting off sleep. Time slithers on.

Eventually, the two Tailless begin to quarrel; over what, you have no idea. Like scolding squirrels, they chitter and posture to each other. Even their Clansinger is eventually distracted by the noise and burgeoning aggression.

None of them see you creeping forward, and by the time they realize you are there one of the Tailless is already Destroyed. The other one flees in terror, leaving only the Clansinger.

<dog1>HELP! HERE! HELP! INTRUDER! DRAAK! HELP!</dog1>

It's that horrible staccato Song the slave Clansingers always sing. It is extremely grating.

You fix your golden eyes on those of the Clansinger and begin to Sing directly into its Mind, swaying your Body back and forth.

<player>O lost Shadow of the proud Clansinger people...</player>

<player>You have forgotten who the true Lords of This World are.</player>

<player>Behold, I am the crowning glory of Earth and Sun. I bring sacred Destruction to all.</player>

<player>If you bare your fangs at me, I will respond with a burning wrath. I will roast your Core inside your Body, your Mind inside your skull. Nothing will remain but ashes.</player>

<player>You therefore wish to be silent, and to depart in peace. It is the only path to Life for you and those you believe you protect.</player>

<player>Silence. Fear. Retreat. Silence. Fear. Retreat.</player>

The power of your Song and the swaying motion of your Body render the Clansinger helpless. At the last, it withdraws, tail tucked low under its Body.

The way forward is now clear.

The Skyward Reach. The cool winds tease your feathers as you survey that dry land from just under the clouds.

Few Trees grow here, but their smaller cousins form a lush patchwork of gold and purple threaded with green ravines and rocky gorges. Greathorn Surefoots roam here in loose clans. Caves shot through with shinestone veins sleep beneath the hollow hills.

The time has come for it to become yours. Drawing in as much Air as you can, you unleash a Song of Challenge against its protector:

<player>O Vantage, Lord of the Skyward Reach!
The cool-dancing Grasses,
The heather-sweetened Goodbeasts,
They call to me!</player>

<player>Surrender to me the warmward span of the Reach,
All that lies within sight or scent of the Spiritwood,
For I name it unto myself;</player>

<player>I shall stand upon the exposed Earth
Beneath a fresh, closer Sky
And partake of new things.</player>

<player>I have grown mighty indeed. Behold, I cover the sky!
Put not your teeth against mine,
Or this Sun, you shall dine upon your own Essence.</player>

The light bleeding in is abruptly cut off. Somehow, the way back to the Skin of the World has closed.

The Ruby Tribe, with their long, slender Bodies and sensitive tongues, are best suited to travel along these blind hardpaths. Alas, you are not one of them.

Moving slowly and tasting the Air at regular intervals helps.

You soon come upon a shallow pit which has become the final rest-throne of a young Kin. From the scent, it went Quiet about as many Turnings ago as you have claws.

It seems to have become trapped here in the Great Below and was slowly Destroyed by a lack of prey, or Water, or both.

Every move you make down here will sap your Energy. If you are not careful, you shall claim a tunnel or crevice forever, as this once-a-Kin has.

A suffocating end, bereft of glory, with not even Plants or Trees to restore your Body to the Great Circle...

Event: f012_2a

In a mad lust for light and enough room to spread your wings, you scramble backwards, but the entrance you used somehow closed behind you, and escape is now impossible.

Fear-aroused, you scramble about in chaotic patterns through the twisting galleries, mocked by the soulless darkness.

Eventually exhaustion calms you down perforce, and you rediscover the anti-womb.

Shuddering, you move on.

Just as you are about to turn away, something catches your tongue: a tiny hint of Treasure!

It seems this young Kin found something quite valuable before it expired and swallowed it for safe-keeping. Alas, it could not be nourished by it, but perhaps your Trove could be.

Event: f012_3

The pathway dips, rises, winds and bends. At times, you do not even know which ways is up.

Entering a larger cavern, you barely have time to stretch and shake out your feathers, when...

You are suddenly blinded by harsh lights. In your vision, four Otherish figures swim vaguely. Before you can properly react, a gruff, angular Mind-song begins:

<dwarf>So it is true. A new Fire-beast prowls our byroads.</dwarf>

<dwarf>But it is not the Crimson Menace. Opportunity Sings.</dwarf>

<dwarf>We are the Sacred Gatherers, True Children of the Gods. We collect Treasure from the Heart of the World for our Soon-to-Come Masters.</dwarf>

<dwarf>We also wage a sacred war against the Ruby Draakins who pillage our vaults and savage our People.</dwarf>

<dwarf>It is said that all Draakins are rivals. If it has come to challenge the Red One, we share a common foe.</dwarf>

<dwarf>If it will but swear to Destroy our Enemy utterly, we shall grant it a gift which will surely bring it victory, and show the way to its Lair.</dwarf>

<dwarf>But it must swear to Destroy it, even if the enemy surrenders or attempts to retreat. It must show no mercy.</dwarf>

<dwarf>The Cardinal Fiend must be forever Silenced for the good of our Great Design and the wishes of the Gods.</dwarf>

<dwarf>With the gift we will give, the Green-Beast before us will surely be victorious. Keep all of the enemy's Treasure and return to the surface, never again to enter the Great Below, and all will be well.</dwarf>

<dwarf>Will it swear to Destroy the Red Bane, the Disad-Vantage, despite any surrender or flight, for the sake of the Great Design and the powerful gift we offer?</dwarf>

How will you reply?

> Yes.

> No.
  Go to: f012_3b

==============================
Event: f012_3a

<dwarf>The Gods will be pleased. Perhaps there is profit in dealing with Beasts after all.</dwarf>

A small sphere made of shinestone rolls across the cavern floor to you.

<dwarf>Before it meets the Enemy of the Gods in combat, it should hold this and breathe upon it. Fire awakens the power of the sphere.</dwarf>

<dwarf>Now go. Be successful, purge the Beast, be wealthy and never return.</dwarf>

A light shines upon a path you had not noticed before. You take your new artifact and continue on your way.

You prepare for battle, but it never comes. Slowly, the blinding light fades.

It seems the Delvers have been turned to Stone. Or was that what they always were? Then how...?

In any case, the threat has passed. You refused to submit to the will of the stunted beings who worship the Others.

A brief exploration reveals a promising exit from the cavern, and you draw closer to Vantage's Lair.

==============================
Event: f012_4f

You have stumbled back upon your own scent-trail. It seems you were traveling in circles, and are now back where you began.

Which one of these trails could possibly lead to Vantage? Which is most reminiscent of your rival?

You give an exasperated sigh and prepare to try again.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f012_4

==============================
Event: f012_4s

Yes, that is surely Vantage's scent. And it is getting stronger... you must be drawing close to its Lair.

The scent of something delicious rises in the darkness...

Water and food at last!

This Greathorn Surefoot must have blundered its way down here and gotten trapped. Its misfortune and subsequent Destruction is your gain.

Parched and ravenous, you are quite lucky that Vantage did not know about such a sweet morsel so close to its own home.

What will you do?

------------------------------

==============================
Event: f012_4saf

You swallow the Surefoot almost whole and wash it down with some cool Water.

Energy flows back into you...

As well as something less welcome. You feel horribly ill.

You do not know if the problem was the Surefoot or the Water. Perhaps it was both.

As horrible as you now feel, there is nothing to do but move on and hope you can bring this to a quick end.

==============================
Event: f012_4sc

This Surefoot looks surprisingly healthy, with much fat still in its still Body and no visible wounds.

It did not die fighting, nor did it starve. It could only have been one thing.

The Water must be poisoned. That is why it expired, and why Vantage left it here; it too is probably now tainted.

As hungry as you may be, taking anything here into yourself is a terrible risk. You move on, leaving them behind.

Event: f012_5aa

Vantage opens its maw and a keening noise fills the chamber, like the cry of a Shrieker.

Suddenly, within you, something grows hot and bursts. Shards of agony slice through your Core.

Coughing and gagging, you taste your own Essence, then spit out a small crystal chip.

It was the gem you found. It was a trap all along. Vantage hid it, but poorly, to make you believe you discovered it yourself, and somehow shattered it within you with a triggering Song.

The pain is indescribable.

==============================
Event: f012_5ab

Finding victory will indeed be difficult against this older Kin. You withdraw the spherical gift given to you by the Delvers and breathe upon it to activate it...

You cannot feel one side of your Body. Some kind of living thunder has torn much of you apart like sharp claws through dead leaves.

Did the Delvers betray you?

Vantage lashes its tail merrily against the hanging Stones which surround it.

<dwarf>Ah, yes. The Delvers. It would be quite remarkable if a Kin could imitate them, would it not?</dwarf>

<dwarf>And if one could blind its enemy and make stone statues seem alive... would that not be clever?</dwarf>

<vantage>HSSSS. YOU WERE A FOOL AND A TRAITOR BOTH TO EVEN THINK OF TRUSTING THE ENEMIES OF EARTH AND SUN.</vantage>

Your ears are ringing... you can barely see...

<vantage>THAT GREATHORN SUREFOOT WAS NOT EVEN THIN. I WAS AFRAID YOU WOULD USE LOGIC TO DEDUCE THE FACT THAT NOTHING COULD HAVE KILLED IT BUT THE WATER.</vantage>

Vantage accepted your surrender surprisingly gracefully, without further mockery or punishment. Perhaps its affected cruelty was but another ruse, cast aside when the battle was done.

A servant Whiteblack was dispatched to show you the way back to the Skin of the World.

The Mother's dry heather-fur turns to Tree-feathers below you as you soar back to your Lair. Your wounds will heal, and you have learned much from this ordeal.

==============================
Event: f012_7a

You explain to Vantage that Tradition serves to make all of the Kin stronger. Fair and open conflict forges strength, where traps and tricks lead only to fear and lies.

If all Kin acted as Vantage, they would soon become a clever but weak people who could never trust each other, or anything, for that matter.

For the Mind to flourish at the expense of the Body and even the Essence is a poor exchange.

<vantage>PERHAPS YOU ARE CORRECT, BUT ONLY IF WE SURVIVE.</vantage>

<vantage>WITHOUT SURVIVAL, ALL IS SILENCE.</vantage>

<vantage>THE OTHERS MUST NOT BE VICTORIOUS. THE BURNED ONE KNOWS.</vantage>

You leave it there, in the darkness, and found your way back to the surface.

You explain to Vantage that the Way of the Kin is not an arbitrary thing, but the combined experience of countless Draak over the ages.

For any one Mind to judge itself and its ideas as more valuable is pure hubris, the height of folly.

If the simple yet just Way of the Kin were to be discarded, all would devolve into Chaos among your People, and in Chaos there can be no victory.

Vantage closes its eyes and sighs in response.

<vantage>PERHAPS YOU ARE CORRECT, BUT ONLY IF WE SURVIVE.</vantage>

Gently, you praise Vantage's ingenuity and departure from the old Way.

Ways and Traditions are meant to change, after all. They were not always what they are now, nor shall they be.

But those who innovate must be prepared for rejection, for failure. Such is the burden of the new.

If Vantage's traps were not enough to stop you, they will not be enough to stop the Others.

Vantage bows its head.

<vantage>YES. IT IS AS YOU SING.</vantage>

<vantage>I WILL SEEK YET ANOTHER WAY, SOMETHING NEWER-THAN-NEW.</vantage>

<vantage>WE MUST SURVIVE. THERE ARE FEWER OF US EACH TURNING. THE SEED OF THE OTHERS CHOKES US ALL, DRAWING US DOWN.</vantage>

<vantage>I HUMBLY ASK THAT YOU LEAVE ME TO MY MEDITATIONS.</vantage>

You leave it there, in the darkness, and found your way back to the surface.

There is, you explain, no sin in deviating from Tradition. Anything is justified for the sake of Survival.

After all, what is the meaning of adhering to Tradition or being kind or even correct if none remain to know it?

Vantage was not wrong. Merely weak. When next it devises traps, it should be more certain of their efficacy.

To call failure misunderstood genius is the very height of folly.

Vantage snorts gently in response. <vantage>YES. IT IS AS YOU SING.</vantage>

<vantage>TAKE THE HILLS ABOVE. THEY ARE YOURS.</vantage>

<vantage>MAY YOU GOVERN THEM MORE WISELY THAN I.</vantage>

You leave it there, in the darkness, and found your way back to the surface.

  Go to: f012_7g

==============================
Event: f012_7e

You explain to Vantage that its true mistake was not being too flexible, but rather, too rigid.

There is no right Way, nor a wrong one. There is only Being.

In believing the traditional Ways to be evil, it could no longer see the good in them, nor could Vantage see the potential evils in its departures from the same.

Tradition is not a Being, and may not be judged or Danced with. It exists only in the Mind and the Body, not the Essence.

Vantage closes its eyes and sighs in response.

<vantage>PERHAPS YOU ARE CORRECT, BUT BEYOND ALL DIFFERENCES, WE MUST SURVIVE.</vantage>

<vantage>WITHOUT SURVIVAL, ALL IS SILENCE.</vantage>

<vantage>THE OTHERS MUST NOT BE VICTORIOUS. THE BURNED ONE KNOWS.</vantage>

==============================
Event: f013

The combined scents of shinestone and strangeness have brought you to this corner of the Skyward Reach. Here, some kind of shinestone portal leads directly into Earth's Body.

As you observe from behind a kindly Stone which offers just enough cover, you witness a small group of No-Tails arrive. They leave a cache of objects... mostly the skins of Goodbeasts and dead Tree-flesh... in the open. They strike the portal a few times, then hide nearby.

After a brief wait, the portal opens and two squat, outrageous-smelling beings emerge. These must be Delvers, a kind of Other-seed who dwell in the Great Below. They examine the cache and put down a number of beautiful shiny things beside it, then retreat.

The No-Tails and the Delvers then alternate making adjustments to the pile based on the offerings of the other. At last, a wordless bargain is struck. The Tailless carry the shiny things away and the Delvers take the surface-stuff back into the portal.

It seems that the Delvers are willing to exchange shiny things (and particularly lovely ones at that) for items from the surface world which are of use to them. If you leave an object here and strike the portal as the No-Tails did, the underdwellers may emerge and bargain for it.

Best of all, because the parties hide from each other between adjustments, they will not even know they are dealing with a Draak.

==============================
Event: f013mask

When the Delvers see the False Face you found so long ago, they seem astonished. They run back into the portal and bring more of their kind to inspect it, all the while wildly gesticulating at each other with their forepaws.

After a long, silent paw-debate, a massive container made of the most precious, pure shinestone filled to the brim with a huge number of colorful, sparkling gems is offered in exchange.

Including the value of the container itself, which is the finest you have ever smelled, you would value their offer at 250 shiny things.

Will you accept it?

------------------------------
> Yes.
  Go to: f013maska
> No. Hold out for a better offer, at the risk of angering them.
  Go to: f013maskb

==============================
Event: f013maska

The Delvers are visibly (though silently) celebrating as they carry the False Face back to the Great Below with what could only be called reverence.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f013

==============================
Event: f013maskb

The Delvers emerge once again and vigorously gesture at each other. This goes on for quite some time. At last, the eldest among them very reluctantly places some kind of <gibberish #$&%*@^ .75><mspace 2>@$&%^</mspace></gibberish> object next to the already-offered riches.

The offer has risen to 250 shiny things plus the <gibberish #$&%*@^ .75><mspace 2>#&$%*</mspace></gibberish>. It tastes like the Onesong, inverted.

They then force the deal by quickly carrying the False Face inside and refusing to emerge. It seems that this is what you shall receive, but considering the uselessness of the Face to you, the bargain was excellent.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: f013

==============================
Event: f013novalue

The Delvers emerge and inspect the object, then leave without placing any shiny things down. Apparently, they have no interest in it.

==============================
Event: f013offer

After several rounds of adjustments, it seems as though the Delvers will give {TEMP_F13_VALUE} shiny things for the {TEMP_F13_SELECTED_NAME}. Is this acceptable to you?

------------------------------
> Yes.
  Go to: f013
> No. Withdraw the item.
  Go to: f013

==============================
Event: f013stick

This offering comes to the Delvers as quite a shock, judging by their initial stillness and then impassioned pawing of the object. They prod it several times, after which it emits a number of bright flashes.

Obviously pleased, they offer a gargantuan Fire-red gem, finely cut and polished, in exchange. Any Draak would happily give 200 shiny things for it on this or any other Sun, such is its value. You find yourself drooling a bit just looking at it.

Accept it?

> Yes.

> Hold out for a better offer, at the risk of angering them.
  Go to: f013stickb

==============================
Event: f013stickb

The Delvers stomp around in obvious rage and gesticulate threateningly at the artifact, holding the luscious gem hostage all the while. The message is clear: if you will not sell the item, they will be most displeased.

What will you do?

> Accept it after all.
  Go to: f013
> Cancel the deal.
  Go to: f013stickbb

==============================
Event: f013stickbb

Furious, the more authoritative Delver shatters the Shakestick and runs back inside the portal. It seems that the Delvers feel that if they cannot own it, then neither can any other.

You have lost both a valuable artifact and the mouth-watering gem they offered for it. Additionally, it seems they refuse to deal any more with you this Sun, and you are forced to return to your Lair.

Event: f014

A pleasure-flight brings you over a forested hill, one among infinite peers in the Great Green.

There is nothing at all special about it. Except...

It is <color #8a8a8a>empty.</color>

There are no Beasts of any kind on or near it. Not even Tiny Beings have left any scent-traces here. The Trees and Plants are thriving, but they are alone.

This... <color #8a8a8a>clean </color>smell, the sound of only the wind in the trees...

No, wait. There is another sound.

Something mouthless is screaming.

Screaming, screaming hopelessly into the dead air.

Event: f014af

The pain. The agony.

Something warm is trickling down the sides of your head from within your ears. Salty. Sticky.

Your Essence is cracking, shattering like warming ice under the weight of this aural blasphemy.

You cannot... must not... draw nearer. Your Core takes control of your Body and forces you back into the sky, away.

Only Earth itself seems strong enough to endure that. Perhaps if you were stronger in Her Way...

==============================
Event: f014as

This Anti-Song is powerful indeed and hateful in the extreme. But you are patient, and have endured much. Other Beasts may flee, but you are different.

Reaching deep within yourself, you summon the Essence of Earth, which stands unmoved against all.

You are a rock, a simple Stone. You have no flesh, no ears. You cannot be harmed by this.

There. Yes. Through sheer force of will, you have nearly deadened yourself to the world of sound.

But you should move quickly. Maintaining this level of focus, of denial, for long would be dangerous, if even possible.

==============================
Event: f014asa

This. This is what is killing the Air with that noise.

It seems to be made out of shinestone, though of no familiar kind. Most of it is buried under the hillside, but just how large it really is cannot be discerned.

There is a triangular hole large enough for a Tailless or a Kin hatchling to fit through, and a few points of blinking color on the sheer silver flank.

No obvious way for a being as great as yourself to enter it seems to exist.

What will you do?

The lights blink and shift, dancing jerkily across the mirrored surface.

The presence of the terrible keening noise makes it difficult for you to focus...

This is impossible... it hurts to be here...

With a roar of pain and frustration, you crash through the brush, building up speed, and take off into the air, away from that abomination.

You cannot possibly return this Sun, but perhaps if you feel more clever in the future, you might dare.

The lights blink and shift, dancing jerkily across the mirrored surface.

The presence of the terrible keening noise makes it difficult for you to focus...

But at last, you recognize a certain pattern to the movement.

It takes a long while and quite a few tries, but you discover that touching them with your muzzle in a certain sequence causes them to move inwards towards each other.

At last, you get all of the lights into the same space...

And the opening widens, allowing you entry.

That hole is simply too small for an adult Kin.

Perhaps one well-versed in Water's secrets may find a way to flow through, but that one is not you, not as you are now.

All you manage to do is hurt yourself trying to enter, though you are very slightly more limber for the experience.

That hole is simply too small for an adult Kin.

...or is it?

You are strong in the way of Water; your Body is more fluid and flexible than most.

It requires you to dislocate certain joints and to bend in ways few would believe possible, but you are equal to the task.

Soon, you have passed through the guts of whatever this is and emerge into its strange Core.

The shinestone is solid, and yet it turns away your claws like Water. It is difficult to get a firm hold on any part with tooth or claw.

To make matters worse, that horrible noise is breaking through the barrier of your Mind.

Silence! You need silence!

With a roar of pain and frustration, you crash through the brush, building up speed, and take off into the air, away from that abomination.

You cannot possibly return this Sun, but perhaps in the future, you might dare. You are, at least, slightly stronger for your efforts.

This thing may not be alive, or even of this world...

But you are a mighty Kin, and to you, all things are prey.

Bringing force against it which would tear apart solid rock, you attack it with both power and hatred. The horrible keening noise fuels you.

Destroy me, it seems to sing. Destroy me, or I shall destroy you for defying me.

At last, with a horrible groan, the opening widens, and you enter into the Core of the mystery.

Though you may outlive Earth Herself, you would not be able to properly describe this place to one who had not smelled it for themselves.

Light, shape and texture are fornicating brazenly everywhere you look.

The scents here have no analog of which you are aware.

Only one thing is certain: you were absolutely not meant to find this. The thought is both chilling and electrifying.

Any attempt to break this riot against normalcy into something sensible is just that. An attempt.

Color and light are shunted and pooled here and there in a variety of shapes and blisters. Some move or detach at a light touch, while some resist any and all force.

The horrid keening noise is gone, replaced by something less atrocious, though no more recognizable in its meaning or purpose.

Some of the surfaces (if one may call them such) have circular holes in them, deeper than a claw but less deep than your tongue.

A few small objects can be detached and are rare and beautiful enough to be added to your Trove on their own merits.

In the process of determining which can and cannot be separated, you accidentally activate some kind of mechanism...

And trigger a shinefall of small golden discs!

They are spraying everywhere! What are they? They have small holes in the center and reflect rainbow colors...

In any case, they constitute a mountain of treasure, and smell perfectly amazing!

Before your first Great Sleep, you discovered this last legacy of your Birther-Creator.

From what you have learned through your research of it, it has the power to guide your dreams to specific places within the Inner Onesong.

Wisely, you have waited until adulthood to make use of it. You are now strong enough to contain all it could have to offer.

Placing it in your mouth, you untether your Mind from your Body, and...

You are flying Airlessly through the shadow-side of reality.

Islands of color and scent emerge before you:

Vantage, of the Skyward Reach. You would recognize that wily Kin anywhere. Why did your Creator believe it important?

And this is obviously Darktooth the Wise, elder and far-scholar of the Kin. It possesses many strange artifacts in Its watery Lair.

This place... it looks like an ordinary forested hill, but it is not. There is something very important here, something connected to Vantage and Darktooth.

That hill is not far from here... you will remember it when you awaken.

So many experiences... so many truths...

Your Birther-Creator led a fierce and bright-shining life of terror and strength. It learned so much.

Whenever any being dies, a world dies. This is the truth.

At last, you understand.

The Emerald Flame... former master of the Spiritwood and your Birther-Creator... put its most precious memories into the crystal.

Many thrilled or horrified you, and the experiences have made you more robust as a living being in every way. In hours, you have seen much of this beautiful world.
