  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: dl1af

You lock your jaws around the cover and pull against it, but you are not powerful enough to coax it out of its place. Eventually, you give up, having nothing but a sore neck and the taste of rusted shinestone in your mouth for your vigorous efforts.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl1bs, dl1

==============================
Event: dl1as

Grasping the cover with your mouth and forepaws, you brace yourself against the ground and lunge backwards. It sings a grinding Song of Objection, but you exert all of the Fire within your Body against it, and finally it comes loose, sending you sprawling backward. You release the cover, swallowing a few small bits of rust (which tastes pleasantly of red Essence). The way into this mysterious den is now open.



------------------------------

  Go to: dl1s

==============================
Event: dl1base

As you explore the base of the mountain which splits Heartbone Valley, a curious scent captures your attention. It smacks of shinestone, but with a hint of fire and sweet rot.

Following the scent, you come to the entrance to some kind of den. It is blocked with water-eaten shinestone, browned with decay. Some of the smells which emanate from it have hints of crystal and other, stranger things. A spark of excitement runs from your forehead through to the tip of your tail; there may well be treasure here.

You successfully made your escape, but not until you were near the entrance did your pursuers give up the chase. You may now choose to leave or to enter the depths once again.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl1s, dl1

==============================
Event: dl1bf

The many strange smells emanating from below are rather distracting. You notice nothing but the fact that this cover is annoyingly solid, and unfortunately positioned, as well.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl1

==============================
Event: dl1bs

There seems to be a small piece of shaped shinestone a snout's length below the cover. It probably serves some purpose... perhaps it opens the cover?

You cannot reach it with your tongue or talons.

> Leave it alone for now.
  Go to: DayTransition

==============================
Event: dl1cf

You have grown quite a bit since hatching, and you suspect that this timeworn shinestone will break under your weight. You take a running start and leap at the cover, crashing downwards and into it. Unfortunately, the cover remains unimpressed, and all you have to show for your efforts is pain. You will need to find some other way.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl1bs, dl1

==============================
Event: dl1cs

You have grown quite a bit since hatching, and you suspect that this timeworn shinestone will break under your weight. You take a running start and leap at the cover, crashing downwards and into it. It hurts a little, but you are successful: the cover buckles and falls down the hole.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl1s

==============================
Event: dl1d

Your claws may not reach it, but you are just able to fit your tail into the widest part of the cover. Deftly, you use it to grasp the small shinestone bit below. A few yanks of your Body and it moves, and the cover swings suddenly open. You roar in pain as your tail is pinched, and thrashing, you pull the cover clean off. The way is now clear, though your tail is throbbing.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl1s

==============================
Event: dl1e

You have seen a few of the more clever featherbeasts do this: a stick, grasped in your jaws, can sometimes be useful for dealing with small spaces. It takes some time, but you manage to press the small shinestone bit, and the cover swings open. With a groan, it falls off its hinges, time having eroded its joints to the breaking point.

  Go to: dl2e

==============================
Event: dl2base

Once you reach the bottom of the shaft, it levels out. With some difficulty, you manage to turn so that you are moving snout-first. There is almost no light in here, making your eyes nearly useless, but traces of interesting scents abound. There is something below, as well as the traces of small furbeasts moving through the area.

You have made only a little forward progress when you sense something in the darkness before you: it is a Baretail, one of a tribe of small furbeasts renowned for their keen senses and knack for survival, even against great difficulties. There is something very... strange about this one, however, something both wrong and right. Surprisingly, it does not flee from you, but approaches and calls out to you with its Mind.

<neverever>One and one combine into two; two and two combine into four; four and four combine into many. By the enlightened Mind I bear, which can grasp even Number, and in the name of Survival, this one brings warning; danger awaits in the abandoned lair of the Others.

<neverever>Guardians living and unliving bar the way below. You tempt Destruction by your presence. We do not threaten; we only advise, Great-Kin-to-Be.</neverever>

You have never heard of a mere Baretail able to communicate in such a way - normally, their thoughts are shallow and easily-understood.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl2

==============================
Event: dl2d

A Baretail is a worthy snack; however, as soon as you even entertain the notion of consuming it, a horrible noise floods your Mind, stabbing white daggers flooding your vision with a haze of blinding light. You panic, writhing about and slamming your Body into the too-hard denwalls.

When your vision clears, the Baretail is gone, leaving not even a scent trail behind. Was it even ever here? You cannot be certain...

------------------------------
> /EndEvent
  Go to: Backgrounds/L1/L1Manager

==============================
Event: dl2e

The Baretail makes a low-snouted gesture of submission and respect, and then retreats into the darkness. It leaves not even a scent trail behind, which is slightly terrifying; a beast without a scent is a defiance of all you know to be true.

This is a trove of decayed vegetable matter crowned with a triumphant palace of mushrooms.

==============================
Event: dl3aa

You have no choice... something in this makes you want to take another bite, and then another, and then another. You never suspected that something without the sweet, red blood of more complex beings could be so delectable. You feel renewed and invigorated.



------------------------------

There is something deeply suspicious about just how badly the flavor makes you want more. With a mighty application of your willpower, you wrench yourself back.

  Go to: dl3

==============================
Event: dl3base

You have found a curious enclosed space. Plant organs were once gathered here into a trove, though you have no idea why; no Draak would find such things valuable. Some kind of mushroom-kin has built a life-den, glowing towers like living treasures extending its reach through the compartment.

It seems to beckon you forward. You have heard that beings such as this are wildly unpredictable. Some are harmless, even beneficial, and some terribly poisonous.



------------------------------

  Go to: dl3, dl3pre

==============================
Event: dl3bf

Attempting to find a Mind to Sing to, you project a standard mental sunrise-greeting. What you receive is a string of colorful, half-formed sigils and images which make absolutely no sense:

==============================
Event: dl3bs

Attempting to find a Mind to Sing to, you project a standard sunrise-greeting outward. What you receive is a string of sigils and images that seem to make absolutely no sense, a chirping symphony of color and happy emotions, but you perceive it to be but a covering for something beneath.

It is very difficult, but you finally unearth the true communication, though it still seems difficult to understand:

<blue_fungus>EXPLORATION STATUS L1.21B - CONFIRMING PRESENCE OF LEGATE-CLASS BIOFORM; EXPANSION OPPORTUNITY EQUALS POSITIVE, CONTINUING COLONIST RELEASE INITIATIVE B-2. BROADCASTING DECOY SIGNAL ON FREQUENCY V19723486A82664N277980.</blue_fungus>

  Go to: dl3

==============================
Event: dl3c

Small colonies of the blue fungus have taken root in most of the mulch that was once tubers and other Plant organs. You do find a several shiny stones among them, however.

You sneeze, scattering blue spores with a small flash of flame from within.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl3

==============================
Event: dl3d

You belch up a large quantity of fireseed and breathe it out all over the fungus. It takes several applications of flame before it finally dies, its twisted corpse emitting fine wisps of white-blue smoke which curl into haloes in the darkened Air.

Everything else here has also perished in the fire, and there is nothing more of value.

Sky-shaded flecks of the fungus drift lazily through the air. A strange tang creeps through your senses. In order to investigate this any further, you will need to breathe in the progeny-flecks of the strange fungus here.

  Go to: dl4b

==============================
Event: dl4a

You cautiously dip just a single unfeeling feather into one of the solutions, and it blackens, withering like a leaf in the breath of an elder Draak-Kin. Apparently, at least some of these liquids are highly dangerous.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl4

==============================
Event: dl4b

The large chunk of shinestone smells very interesting indeed, but it is far too heavy for you to move about freely with. If you take this with you now, you will need to return to your den with it immediately, as its weight would make defending yourself or even exploring burdensome in the extreme.

Take the weighty thing back to your den with you and leave this place now? You could still return on another day, but you will have to find your way back here again on your own. It will cost valuable Suns.

------------------------------
> Yes, take it and leave.
  Go to: DayTransition
> No, leave it and remain here for now.
  Go to: dl4

==============================
Event: dl4base

You have entered a large square-walled chamber filled with tens upon tens of strange pools. The round basins are filled with angry, bizarre-scented substances. Even just taking some of these bizarre Essences into your nose makes your Mind become unstable, or makes you want to regurgitate. Others have soothing, almost seductive aromas. Most are mottled, containing odors actively at war with each other. No other living beings have been in this room for many Turnings.

Near the center of a room on a piece of Other-mutilated rock rests a large piece of something like shinestone, though it smells far more acrid. Most of the pools seem to have at least a trace of the scent of this strange thing in them.

What do you do?

------------------------------
> Climb down the shaft using the claws and fangs to support you.

> Use the Obstinate Stone to stop the fangs.
  Go to: dl5e
> Leave this place.
  Go to: Backgrounds/L1/L1Manager

==============================
Event: dl5a

The sides are sheer, smooth shinestone, so you attempt to place a forepaw on one of the unliving fangs for support. As soon as you reach for it, however, it jumps to sudden, unnatural life.

With a high-pitched whine, the claws and fangs begin to whir about in circles at great speed. Your paw is slashed before you have a chance to even draw back... in fact, had you been even a bit slower, the whirling deathfangs would have severed your forepaw altogether.

It is unclear what kind of magic is at work here, but it is indubitably deadly.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl5

==============================
Event: dl5b

As soon as you release the shiny, the shinestone fangs suddenly whirl into a storm of sharp activity; by the time they cease their mad Dance of Great Destruction, the shiny is gone, smashed and sliced to tiny bits.

Soon, the mass of circling deathclaws is quiet once again, but it seems clear that they can sense things somehow, and are hungry and wrathful.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl5

==============================
Event: dl5base

This revealed passageway is dominated by many talons and fangs wrought of pure shinestone. A warm crimson light spills upward from below.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl5

==============================
Event: dl5c

With all your feathers standing on end in fear and anticipation, you reach out a forepaw downwards at a pace slow as a tiny Slimeshell slides up a blade of grass. The fangs and claws remain safely dormant. It seems as though they react only to quicker motions.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl5

==============================
Event: dl5d

Your Core pleads with you not to do this exceptionally dangerous and unwise thing. If you slip just once, if your tail twitches too quickly, if you make the slightest normal move while climbing down, the shinestone Destroyer will rend your flesh from your bones and smash even those to pieces such that what emerges down below will not even be recognizable as a Kin.

A more painful and ugly death could not possibly exist to the best of your imagination.

------------------------------
> Turn back.
  Go to: dl5r
> No, you are determined to risk painful evisceration to see what lies below.
  Go to: dl5db

==============================
Event: dl5db

Whatever exists below this shaft, which may well contain neither food nor treasure, cannot possibly be worth having your precious and beautiful life utterly Destroyed in an instant, your Body and your Essence devoured by these clawfang abominations which have not even a Mind. This is your final chance to turn back. If you proceed and fail, there will be no chance whatsoever of survival.

Are you truly prepared to face eternal Silence just for the sake of your own curiosity?

------------------------------
> Yes.
  Go to: dl5ds, death
> No.
  Go to: dl5r

==============================
Event: dl5ds

The terror.

The horror.

The crushing, Mind-strangling fear of knowing that even one tiny moment of impatience or imperfection would mean the worst of deaths.

The slow, slow descent down that shinestone tree of Destruction seemed as long to you as your entire life thus far. You nearly panic several times.

And yet, thanks to the calming, steadying Earth element within you, you keep every movement slow, slow as the grass grows beside the river, slow as Time raises up new kinds of Bodies to house new Essences. You are patient enough, calm enough, and you survive, dropping at last onto a warm and hard floor.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl6, dl6c

==============================
Event: dl5e

The Water-spirit gave you this large stone that it could not break down to sand, not even with tens of thousands of Turnings - if it could not, perhaps these death-claws will also fail. Carefully, you lower the Obstinate Stone down until the sharp things whir to life, gnashing greedily, and the Stone is snatched from your paw.

The Stone sticks in the hellish craw, and the fangs crunch in dismay as they grind to a halt. You wait for a long, long time, but they do not start up again so long as the Obstinate Stone is wedged within, and after you are satisfied that they have gone Quiet, you carefully make your way down the protrusions, dropping at last onto a hard, warm stone floor.

Event: dl5r

{TEMP_DL5R=1 Wisely, you reject the morbid proposition and opt for a safer alternative.}

==============================
Event: dl6

Waves of heat caress your form as you look about this arid chamber. The very air shimmers, dancing with joy to be in such a place. Baretails scurry about, entering and leaving in a steady flow, largely ignoring you.

Near the center of the wide open space, in a round pit of low but intense flames, several beings are lounging. Despite the heat, they wear expressions of comfort and contentment only slightly tinged with caution and curiosity at your sudden presence. The largest of them raises its snout, sniffs the air and focuses its flaming eyes on you.

<salamander>Ah! One of the Draak-Kin. Welcome, honored guest. We rejoice at your presence. May Fire, the Ever-Young, bless you with its many glories.

<salamander>Times must be cold and grim in the Ceilingless Lands if a Draak, even a hatchling, must come so far below for sustenance.</salamander> The scarlet being quickly seizes a large Baretail giver in its jaws and cranes its neck, holding it out for you. The furbeast does not resist.

Event: dl6ba

<salamander>Perhaps you know it by another name. Enkindling is what the great dark one who changed our nature called it. It is a power held within the Draak-Kin to set alight the souls of lesser beings and bring out hidden truths within their Bodies and Minds.

<salamander>Before we were Enkindled, we were mere Water-beasts, scrabbling about in shallow pools for sustenance. Now that we are Enkindled, we bathe in Fire, our Bodies have become larger and stronger, and our Minds comprehend many things which we could not before.

Other than knowing that it is made of no material yet discovered and cannot be Destroyed by any craft known to us, we understand not its power, but perhaps a great Draak would be able to fathom its secrets.

  Go to: dl6c

==============================
Event: dl6ccf

The Salamanders regale you with their beliefs and experiences in becoming beings of Fire, and while much of it is of no interest, a few of their songs do grant you a deeper understanding of the element of hunger, rage, ambition, and strength.



------------------------------
> [Continue]
  Go to: dl6c

==============================
Event: dl6ccs

The Salamanders have learned much of Fire, but you are no stranger to its elementary principles, either. You find you have nothing to learn from them, and indeed teach them of the great Burning which fuels all things, even Sun and Earth themselves. In appreciation, they return your offering and add a small amount to it themselves, admitting they are unworthy to be your teachers.

==============================
Event: dl6cd

<salamander>That cursed interloper! All of the Baretails we have sent to Destroy it return tainted by its presence; we cannot even eat them for fear of infection, but only burn them to ashes.</salamander>

<salamander>If we could, we would Destroy it, but drawing close enough to do so is too great a risk; if one of us were to be taken over by its invisible hatchlings, it could mean the end of the Salamanders.</salamander>

<salamander>Stay far away from it, Kin, and do not take into your Body anything which has its terrible cerulean taint.</salamander>{FLAG_DL3FUNGUSBURNED=1

When you inform them that you have burned the fungus away, they thump their tails in joy. <salamander>This is good news indeed! In exchange for Destroying that menace, we offer you some of our lesser Treasure, as well as advice: seek purification for yourself, as you may be tainted by its evil. We know of no cure for the Blue Curse, but perhaps a greater Draak may know.</salamander> }

  Go to: dl6c

==============================
Event: dl6ce

The Salamanders lash their tails, bodies rigid in surprise. <salamander>We acknowledge your right to do so, in accordance of the Way of the blessed Draak, but also in accordance with that Way, we will fight for what is ours. Our great Treasure, the Face of the Others, carries powerful magic, and memories of the victory over the Delvers. Your race may be great, but you are but a hatchling, and we are strong.

<salamander>Will you truly risk your Body in combat with us for our Treasure? Once the Dance of Destruction is begun, we will acknowledge no end but Destruction.</salamander>

------------------------------
> Yes; face their champion in a battle to the death.

==============================
Event: dl6cf

The Salamanders thump their tails and roll about within your flames, clearly overjoyed. <salamander>Ah, such pleasure! Many thanks,</salamander> intones the largest.

<salamander>It has been many Turnings since we felt the blessed heat of Kin-breath on our Bodies. Please, do continue!</salamander>

  Go to: dl6cfa
> Decline... you are beginning to feel tired, and your fire-seed is not endless.
  Go to: dl6cfb

==============================
Event: dl6cfa

You blast forth an intense jet of Fire, bathing them all in it to the best of your ability. The flaming beasts close their eyes, tongues lolling out as they bask in the heat of your breath. When you at last finish, the leader selects a small piece of burnished shinestone from their trove and flings it up at you with a few thoughts of gratitude. It is almost too hot to handle at first, but it is very shiny, if small.

The blazing beings seem disappointed, but do not argue with you.

==============================
Event: dl6cr

{TEMP_DL6CR=1 <salamander>Ah, our most sacred Uplifter, Revealer of New Paths, Bringer of Terror to the Others! The Draak who Enkindled us had armor like the sightless depths of Earth which Light never knew, and a Mind-Voice which burned like Ice, stabbing through our souls. It bore scars, many, many scars, won in countless battles with the Others, whom it hated.

<salamander>Indeed, even the strange magic of the Delvers withered before our great Master, and they fled in terror. The Dark One stayed here for a time, and Enkindled us by its presence, finally moving on. Many Turnings later, the Delvers attempted to regain the strange arcane Face which they had lost, but we thwarted them, and now their Face remains our most prized Treasure. </salamander>
{TEMP_DL6CR=2 <salamander>Ah, yes. They are many, perhaps more than we could ever know. This particular clan has found usefulness in our eyes. They bring us small shiny things and, most importantly, the black fire-stones we rest on and which carry and sustain our flame. We also dine on them, when we hunger.

<salamander>In exchange, we keep greater threats away, and allow them to take our leavings, which they combine with various things to make a black substance which reacts violently when introduced to Fire. It does not harm us, but other beings are severely damaged by it. In our way, perhaps we are slowly Enkindling the Baretails.</salamander>

==============================
Event: dl6d

Their leader slain, the Salamanders present you with their Treasure. <salamander>Have mercy upon us, o great Draak! Though small, you are strong. Take our Treasure, and leave our lair to us and our servants; nothing remains here for you.</salamander>

Having obtained their Treasure, you leave the Delvers' abandoned lair. When you pass by the entrance again, you see that it has been blocked by many stones; afraid of your power, the Salamanders must have ordered the entrance sealed by their Baretail servants.

------------------------------

==============================
Event: dl6retreat

You flee from the wrath of the Burning Ones, barely managing to make it out of their domain alive. When you attempt to return, you find the entrance sealed. Whatever treasure lies there is now out of your reach.

{TEMP_EXPLODED=1 As flame touches the black ball held in the Baretail's mouth, a surge of blinding, pure Destruction suddenly surges forth from it, covering your Body in pain and fire. When you regain your senses, there is nothing left of the mad Baretail.}
{TEMP_EXPLODED!=1 You have managed to slay the mad Baretail before it could do whatever it was trying to do with the black ball held in its mouth. You consume the corpse and take the black ball for your own. It smells rather volatile.}

You break off several pieces of it; it is shiny enough to seem like Treasure, at least to you.

==============================
Event: dlpoi2

{DL_POI2_OPENED!=1 This vein of the tunnel seems to have collapsed from the crushing embrace of Earth.}{DL_POI2_OPENED=1 A blackened path stands now where the collapsed vein once stood, heavy with a volatile scent.}

The crushed vein of the den is blocked off by crumbled earth. It would be too laborious to dig through, but with enough force, the vein could be opened.

==============================
Event: dlpoi2c

Placing the Black Ball among the rubble, you step backwards and prepare the fireseed. Your flaming breath barely touches the orb before it erupts into an outrage of sound and force. The blast clears away the debris, though you are also lightly singed.

The blue fungus which has entered your Body has been filling your lungs more and more with each passing Sun.
