You are exhausted and cold by the end of the long skypath which has brought you here.

The chill, though stubborn, is wiped away by the smell of Earth, Fire, Air and crystal Water coming together. A glowing taste fills the nearby clouds.

This is the territory claimed by Many-Times-Burned, Paragon of the Draak-Kin People.

The tales surrounding that Elder are many. Some say that its Body was burned to charcoal in the Core of the World, its bones bursting and red-cracked, but that its Mind was so strong that it knit itself back together again, though the pain of the exploding moment never receded.

Others say that its Mind was torn from it by circumstances too outrageous to understand, but that its Essence was so mighty that it was able to survive through sheer force of Will.

No one dares to claim that its Essence is what was broken and incinerated by Reality. That would be either a blasphemous falsehood or, if true, too horrible to consider.

Landing on the mountain, you roar out a Song of Annunciation. Hardly any time at all passes before you are greeted by a strange Baretail, its Essence a lurid blaze even against the heat.

<neverever>Three and three make six, nine, one and zero, if "and" is interpreted differently.</neverever>

<neverever>By the enlightened Mind I bear, be welcome, mighty Kin, in the name of the Undying Master.</neverever>

<neverever>This one is Never-Ever, envoy of the Sun-Shadow, the Pulled-Together-and-Apart, the Many-Times-Burned.</neverever>

<neverever>Is the Fourth Lair of the Master not beautiful? Behold: Earth reaches out for the Great Above through Her burning Essence.</neverever>

<neverever>Is it Sun that She yearns to become one with, or the Void? One wonders. One wonders.</neverever>

<neverever>You are expected below. The way is steep; take care not to harm your magnificent Body.</neverever>

<neverever>Yet.</neverever>

<unforgetting>One in Body, but many in Essence.</unforgetting>

<unforgetting>Turnings beyond turnings ago, some from among the Kin sacrificed their limbs to survive the Skyfall.</unforgetting>

<unforgetting>We, the Tailbeast People, are their descendants. My People have forgotten what it was to run, to fly, to breathe out Destruction upon others. To reign.</unforgetting>

<unforgetting>Most Kin saw us as fallen, as degenerate, as food. But the Great Burning One saw us as beautiful. We were willing to sacrifice all for the sake of Survival.</unforgetting>

<unforgetting>The Great One gifted me, greatest of warriors among my Tribe, with a sliver of its eons-deep soul, and I remembered. I remembered all, and became the Unforgetting.</unforgetting>

<unforgetting>I remembered the Kin-Essence which slept always inside me. I remembered that what was lost may be regained.</unforgetting>

You crush the warrior's narrow skull in your jaws and consume it. As the last of its long Tail-Body moves down your throat and into your Core, you feel a rush of vigor.

<neverever>Shall I tell an interesting story as we Descend farther, o Guest?</neverever>

<neverever>Once, there was a Lumberer who was small and weak, as its kind reckons such things. Its prey was often stolen by others, it was never chosen as a Creation-partner, and it rarely knew peace.</neverever>

<neverever>It learned, however. It learned to achieve victory by unorthodox means, but it continued to envy the strong, the seemingly safe, those chosen to Create.</neverever>

<neverever>And so it made the journey here. Employing all of its resources, it defeated the Beholden and arrived before the Great Master itself. There, it expressed its wish to be the very strongest of its kind.</neverever>

<neverever>The Undying One generously granted its request, Enkindling it to make it more fearsome and deadly than any other. As a final gift, the Lumberer was granted the Pain-Killer, a shinestone brace which, when affixed, grants immense strength at the low, reasonable cost of constant pain.</neverever>

<neverever>Despite the fact that the Lumberer had specifically stated that it would pay any price to have its wish fulfilled, the pain was too much for its weak Mind to cope with. It insisted on meeting the Overlord once more, this time to request that the brace be removed and its Body restored to its original state.</neverever>

<neverever>The impertinence of such an ungrateful request!</neverever>

<neverever>Still, it was judged that the Great One would grant it another audience if it were to serve and survive as one of the Beholden, and so it was confined to a Chamber. Its Mind, however, continued to deteriorate under the strain of constant anguish.</neverever>

<neverever>Eventually, everything else was Burned, melted away, until only the Agony was left.</neverever>

<neverever>An amusing story, is it not? I have no doubt that a Kin such as yourself would understand the lesson to be learned from it.</neverever>

Your Descent is progressing; it seems as though you are near to the bottom of the caldera.

Even before you enter the next Chamber, however, you are struck by a strange odor. It reminds you of the Tailless, but it is not nearly as noisome. It might be compared to salt-Water on grey, cold slate which has been trod upon by many No-Tail feet.

This being seems not to have a tail, but it is definitely of a completely different kind from the common Tailless which you have known. It is larger. Stronger.

Purer.

Its Mind-song is slightly veiled behind a layer of mental difference, but what you can understand of its sigils is not without a certain beauty.

<last>O past-enthroned encompasser of Sky and Ground; openly, I recognize your puissance.</last>

<last>I am known as Last. As yours, my species has similarly been disenfranchised by tragedy.</last>

<last>However, even the storied Skyfall was anemic in comparison to the living tide which drowned my compatriots, such that solitude alone is my companion.</last>

<last>There is no destitution, no poverty, like that of mine, for the very future has been shorn away. Though I carry the sacred potential of nascent Life within my form, there are none to awaken it.</last>

<last>Know therefore that I have no fragility, no feebleness. None can be afforded. The Grand Survivor below represents the final hope of my entire genotype.</last>

<last>For the benefit of both of us. Only tragedy can possibly result from the annihilation of either of our existences.</last>

This being is exceptionally strong in every way, and the last of its kind. It is, however, in possession of a rather large pile of Treasure. It must be near to purchasing the favor of Many-Times-Burned.

It raises its head and looks at you. In its eyes, you can see its own Essence and that of its People, once uncountable thousands and now only one.

Your tongue is split by the razor edge between a new beginning and an eternal tragedy.

<MTB>AGONY. THE ONE WHO WITNESSED ITS GREATEST WISH COME TRUE, AND BECAME STRONG, STRONGER THAN ANY LUMBERER.</MTB>

<MTB>COULD THERE BE EVER A GREATER CURSE THAN TO OUTLIVE ONE'S OWN DELUSIONS?</MTB>

<MTB>TO FIND, AT THE END, THAT ONE'S DEAREST WISH WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE?</MTB>

<MTB>AND YET, DESPITE ITS PAIN, ITS INNER DESOLATION, YOU CHOSE NOT TO DESTROY IT.</MTB>

<MTB>ONLY FOOLISH HOPE OR CRUELTY COULD HAVE MOTIVATED SUCH AN ACTION.</MTB>

<MTB>CRUELTY IS SWEET, AND YET ALSO A TERRIBLE ROT WHICH DEVOURS ONE'S ESSENCE.</MTB>

<MTB>AS GREAT A LIE AS COMPASSION IS CRUELTY. ONLY JUSTICE, FREE AND CLEAN FROM BOTH, CAN DELIVER US.</MTB>

<MTB>WIPE THE CRUELTY FROM YOUR SOUL. THERE IS NO PLACE FOR SUCH THINGS AMONG TRUE CHILDREN OF SUN AND EARTH.</MTB>

<MTB>ONE SHOULD WISH ONLY FOR LIFE, ONLY TO BE. ANY OTHER WISH CARRIES THE SEEDS OF ONE'S OWN UNDOING.</MTB>

<MTB>YOU PROVED YOUR SUPERIORITY OVER THE LAST OF THE ENFORCERS IN THE DANCE OF DESTRUCTION.</MTB>

<MTB>HOW THE TAILLESS HATED THEM... AND YET, THEY WERE THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE WILL OF THE OTHERS, THEIR CREATORS. SUCH IRONY.</MTB>

<MTB>WHEN IT BEGGED YOU TO SPARE IT... DID YOU FEEL THE SHALLOW CALL OF COMPASSION? IS THAT WHY YOU ALLOWED IT TO REMAIN?</MTB>

<MTB>IT IS NOT FOR US, NOR FOR ANY, TO BECOME THE DELIVERANCE OF OTHERS. ALL, FROM THE GREATEST TO THE LEAST, MUST ALWAYS BE THEIR OWN SALVATION.</MTB>

<MTB>TO DECLARE ONESELF A SAVIOR... TO BOAST THAT OTHERS EXIST ONLY BECAUSE OF ONE'S OWN GREATNESS...</MTB>

<MTB>NEITHER SUN NOR EARTH INTERVENE ON BEHALF OF THEIR INFINITE CHILDREN, AND IF THEY DO NOT...</MTB>

<MTB>IN THE COMING CLEANSING, SUCH ILLUSIONS MAY BE OUR UNDOING.</MTB>

<MTB>FIND NEITHER PLEASURE NOR PAIN IN THE ENDING OF THE LAST. TIME AND SPACE ARE INFINITE, AND NOTHING TRULY ENDS.</MTB>

Event: fp_5d

Never-Ever leads you by strange ways back to the crisp of the surface.

Few indeed can claim to have been worthy of the attention, however brief, of one such as Many-Times-Burned, the Paragon of Fire.

Your name shall be spoken of with awe by many...

But even such strength as you have shown here is nothing at all to Many-Times-Burned.

In a sense, all this world exists at its discretion. There is no Being bound by flesh which is more powerful upon all of blessed Earth.

But worlds can change, and become new worlds.

Does even the Onesong itself, to which even Sun and Earth are but Tiny Beings, know What Should Be?

Event: fp_6

The Void rushes in as pain severs the link between your Body and your Mind.

You have been utterly defeated, and Destruction should follow...

But you smell cold, salty Water, and when you open your eyes, you see that you are outside the Fourth Lair of Many-Times-Burned.

<neverever>Do not mistake this reprieve for compassion. Such is anathema to the Undying One.</neverever>

<neverever>It was mere pragmatism. When the Master's plan is set into motion, each and every one of the Kin will be needed.</neverever>

<neverever>It would have been a waste for one as bright-burning as you to meet Destruction here.</neverever>

<neverever>Rest, and become stronger. If Earth is to be saved...</neverever>

<neverever>...you must become that which you are not yet.</neverever>

The way inside the Fire-Mountain which you took before seems to have vanished, nor can you find any other.

Great Many-Times-Burned is no longer interested in meeting you, it would seem, but has left you your life, which is, of course, the most valuable of all Treasures.

Time will tell whether its decision to do so was justified. For now, you must continue your existence in the Great Green, under the shadow of those who have endured the eons.

Event: fpa

Never-Ever leads you to a place where the Air itself seems to be constantly melting.

Though you are Kin, one who bears a fragment of Sun's Fire within, you are nonetheless uncomfortably hot; that a Baretail is able to survive here at all is astonishing.

Far, far down, you can make out a shape within the Essence of Earth Herself. It is so huge that at first you mistake it for a dark hill amidst the radiance, but no...

<neverever>Behold our Master Imperishable. Even the Great Mother's own blazing belly-juices can no longer dissolve its hallowed Body.</neverever>

<neverever>And Behold the Proving-Pit, Fourth Lair of the Paragon of Fire. Know this: many come, and few leave. We do not threaten, but only advise, great Kin.</neverever>

<neverever>Tell us: why have you come here?</neverever>

==============================
Event: fpb

<neverever>If you do indeed possess both the ability and the will to Survive, then you will not have come in vain. However, you are not the only aspirant, great Kin.</neverever>

<neverever>Many wait in the chambers. Most have come to beg an audience with the Master.</neverever>

<neverever>The Master's time is valuable, and the ephemeral and soon-gone are unworthy of it.</neverever>

<neverever>In its unfathomable wisdom, the Great One has created a means by which one might earn such a rare Treasure, and others besides.</neverever>

<neverever>In Descending through the spiral walk, you shall encounter the Beholden. Each one holds Treasure of one kind or another, and will not suffer the weak to pass.</neverever>

<neverever>If you Destroy your opponent, you are entitled to its Trove. Whether you seize its Treasure or not, though, victory shall bring you further down, closer to the Master.</neverever>

<neverever>Should you, young as you are, prove stronger than all others, then you shall reach the base, and become worthy of the Invulnerable One's attention.</neverever>

<neverever>Be twice-aware: the Master witnesses all which transpires here. Only its Body sleeps. Only the Body.</neverever>

<neverever>There is no room here for shallow and false Compassion. Survival reigns supreme in the Pit, with Wisdom a welcome guest. All other virtues shall be as walls separating yourself from success.</neverever>

<neverever>Though you may leave and return to continue the Descent at any time, if you wish to do so during a Dance of Destruction, a ransom must be paid: ten shiny things to add to your opponent's Trove.</neverever>

<neverever>Are you prepared to begin the Descent?</neverever>
