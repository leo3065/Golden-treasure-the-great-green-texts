Event: fx6

You are awakened by a lambent glimmer radiating from your Trove.

It seems that the silverfruit you obtained from the mysterious Brightling grove is emitting a pale glow.

You touch the smooth surface lightly with a claw...

The air is suddenly heavy with the scents of unknown Flowers, drawing you down and into yourself.

How... why? That scent...

==============================
Event: fx6a

...

...

Dimly, you become aware of the scent of lightning and shinestone.

There is no breeze, no scent of soil or the sweet rot of Plants. In fact, this place smells as though it never knew the Great Green at all...

Or even Earth Herself.

A dark hexagon, grim and mute, glares down at you. Ghosts drift about and stare at you from behind a wall of melted sand.

A nightmare? You look around...

No. You cannot move your head. You cannot look away.

Your Body can barely move. Trapped, nearly paralyzed.

Is this how your story ends? No Dance of Destruction, no challenge, no last Song?

If they Destroy you, your Body will not even be eaten by Great Earth.

Something horrible and Other is scraping at the inside of your Mind.

  Go to: fx6abs, fx6abf

==============================
Event: fx6aa

You summon your inner Fire to fight against the numerous restraints placed on your Body, violently thrashing with all your might.

However, the colored dead tail-bonds constrict, coiling more tightly, denying you more and more until you are completely locked in place.

You try to Sing out a Song of Rage, but you cannot; the dead tails are squeezing your chest so hard you can barely breathe. Why? Why? Why?

Event: fx6abf

You attempt to calm yourself, yet your instincts and the Fire inside you drives you to action.

You will not allow yourself to be tortured and played with by these Other-ghosts!



------------------------------

  Go to: fx6aa

==============================
Event: fx6abs

Although your instincts call you to action, you realize that the best chance for you to escape is to remain calm and understand this horrid reality and its ghosts.

The calming influence of Earth within you soothes your spirit. You are able to swallow your Fire and meet whatever comes next with clear eyes.

<drone>TRUTH. ONE TRUTH. LET MIIIND COMBINE, BEHOLD. FEEEL. DIGESSSST.</drone>

The dark hexagon is suddenly shouting light at you. Is that... a Woodstrider? But you cannot see its Essence.

It is right there, but you cannot smell it, cannot smell anything but the lightning running through your bonds, around you. Into you.

Forced to look at the image, you cannot help but feel...

------------------------------
> Hunger.
  Go to: fx6ba
> Respect.
  Go to: fx6bb
> Denial - this is not a real Woodstrider.
  Go to: fx6bc

==============================
Event: fx6ba

The sight of the Woodstrider fills you with hunger, and your instincts to Destroy are awakened.

A natural response, to be certain. You are salivating, but cannot move your tongue, causing you to drool.

==============================
Event: fx6bb

Of all the Goodbeasts of the Great Green, the Woodstriders have the purest Essence. They wear the Crown.

The wise among the Kin respect them, even as they hunt them, and you are wise. You understand.

Even stretched across the too-bright hexagon, flattened and scentless, this is still a Woodstrider, and worthy. Very worthy.

  Go to: fx6c

==============================
Event: fx6bc

This is not a real Woodstrider.

Woodstriders have glowing Air and Earth-lines threading through them, winding into beautiful crowns.

This one, stretched and too-real to the eyes, has no Essence. Not all beings have Bodies, but to lack an Essence is to have no existence at all.

This somehow captured the light coming from a Woodstrider and froze it flat, but you are not at all fooled. It is spirit which makes a Woodstrider, not the outer shell.

==============================
Event: fx6c

Your eyes are now assaulted by the image of a No-Tail larva. Again, there is no scent and no Essence to sense.

Your immediate reaction is one of...

------------------------------
> Hunger.
  Go to: fx6ca
> Rage.
  Go to: fx6cb
> Interest - are the Tailless connected to these Other-ghosts?
  Go to: fx6cc

==============================
Event: fx6ca

You cannot smell it, but the oily skin and fatty flesh of No-Tails is known to be quite delicious.

A larva of their kind would be especially tender and sweet, easy to Destroy and consume.

You find yourself quite hungry. Idly, you whether its liver or its eyes would be tastier.

==============================
Event: fx6cb

The No-Tails...

Violators and poisoners, Tree-murdering Kin-slaying Other-Seed...

Breeding out of control, spreading their filthy Hives...

Something is choking you; you panic, struggling vainly. Eventually you realize that it is reacting to your anger, and with great effort, you calm yourself and force down your acrimony (and fireseed).

==============================
Event: fx6cc

You cannot see clearly through the barrier, but these Others bear some resemblance to the No-Tails.

They are lighter, however. Brightlings, perhaps?

That would make sense. The Brightlings are known to take an interest in the Tailless.

As you begin to speculate about their possible relationship, you see movement among the bright beings outside.

==============================
Event: fx6d

How long will this continue? Why are they forcing you to look, and look, and look?

The Tailless larva is now an object made out of gleaming shinestone. It seems to be in the shape of a Kin.

It causes you to feel...

------------------------------
> Appreciation - what skill!
  Go to: fx6da
> Connection - it reminds you of yourself, and all that you are.
  Go to: fx6db
> Anger - how dare they use an image of your People like this?
  Go to: fx6dc
> Desire - it must be yours!
  Go to: fx6dd

==============================
Event: fx6da

You find it gratifying that whatever that created this artifact values the beauty and form of your People.

What is more, it seems to be made out of "gold", one of the ultimate forms of shinestone, a fitting tribute to the greatness of the Kin.

You lack both the skill and the digits necessary to craft such a thing yourself. It is truly valuable, and a testament to the creative skill of the Others and their Seed.

Looking at it, it is hard to think that they are without merit.

  Go to: fx6e

==============================
Event: fx6db

It is, of course, an image of yourself, at least in the abstract. Caught in shinestone, it brings out the organic poetry of your Body.

You are reminded of the other Draak that you have met and bested, and the taste of victory or appreciation that came from such meetings.

You feel the elements dancing inside you, as if attempting to communicate with the likeness of the Draak.

==============================
Event: fx6dc

An unliving Kin - are they mocking you? It is Essence which makes one Draak-Kin, not shape.

Or are they denigrating the Kin's long-standing tradition of the Lesser Law, the gathering of Treasure?

Or attempting to profit from a beauty which is yours, and not theirs?

They will regret this indignity. You know it is futile to try fighting them now, but you will remember this.

The hazy figures move about agitatedly.

Event: fx6dd

This is most definitely Treasure. You feel the Lesser Law pulling at you, urging you to take it.

You think of how beautiful the artifact would look in your Trove, surrounded by other shinestone confections. How honored you would be! How many would wish to Dance with you!

Event: fx6e

As the final image fades, the hexagonal surface darkens again.

The bright beings seem to be moving around and singing to each other, though all you hear is muffled patches of gibberish.

After some time, the symbols appear in your Mind again, somehow both sophisticated and crude, like someone attempting to sing a Song which they have never heard before.

Unable to protest, you are forced into a larger hive with even more restraints.

You cannot help but be fearful, but you know that there is nothing you can do at the moment.

There is no way to measure time in this Not-Place. You are forced to endure much.

Poking, prodding, stabbing. Questions. Light. Sound.

The broken voice seems to be expressing thanks between each task. A cruel joke; gratitude involves respect, and if they had any respect for what you are, you would not be subjected to this.

After what feels like many Moons or even Turnings, small holes open above you, and from the holes comes the unnaturally soothing Flower-scent emitted by the silverfruit.

Was it a nightmare after all? No... at least four Suns have passed, and the silverfruit is gone.

Still feeling sluggish, you stretch and begin your next Sun in a world which you understand and which understands you.
