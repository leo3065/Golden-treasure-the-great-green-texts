Event: ff1

The High Way above the Spiritwood is being taken by more and more Kin.

<dragon>"IT IS TIME!"</dragon> they sing as they pass overhead. <dragon>"THE GRAND MOOT! IT IS TIME!"</dragon>

Your own thoughts are being drawn more and more to the Gathering Isle, the place appointed for this meeting of all Draak-Kin.

The wind ruffles your feathers. You feel Fate scraping against you.

What transpires at the Grant Moot will surely change your Life and bring an end to this final phase of your youth.

The time is ripe. Will you go, and face your destiny?

------------------------------
> Yes. I am ready.
  Go to: ff2
> No, I wish to take three more Suns, to prepare myself. (The Elders may see this as slightly disrespectful.)

So be it. Your lateness may annoy the elders somewhat, but more time to prepare may be worth risking their disfavor.

Event: ff1b_1

It is time. The sky calls.

To delay any further would be to risk the wrath of the Elders, and the loss of everything you have.

And besides, you cannot escape the deep knowledge that this event will change your world.

It is time for the Grand Moot.

==============================
Event: ff2

You follow the gathering flight of Kin coldwards and setwards to a large island emerging from the Great Blue.

Here, at the summit of the Gathering Hill, the future of the True Children of Above and Below will be decided.

Not since the Skyfall has all Draak-kind been gathered together.

To be so close to so many other Draak-Kin is slightly terrifying. Your People are not accustomed to such things, being proud sovereigns each of their own realm, and rivals to one another...

But you must face the terror of togetherness and be present. Too much is at stake to give in to Fear.

==============================
Event: ff2a

Your Essence burns within you as you behold the Kin, amassed.

The beautiful haloes crowning each, from young to old, speak of their many hard-earned epiphanies and triumphs. Some are particularly beloved by a single element, while others have achieved a balance between two, three or even Four.

At the highest crown of the ice-capped, slumbering firemountain, the Elders reign transcendent.

There you see Bladetail-of-the-Many-Minds, ancient guardian of the Far Islands. The spiritual heads which surround its physical one constantly murmur deadly Truths.

There also is Fathom, Keeper of the Depths, who makes its home lower even than the Great Below, mightiest of the Sapphire Clan.

Even Jade Cloud, the soft-sung yet undisputed master of the riseward lands, has come. It is said to have once won an argument with the Moon, and even invented mist.

These three elders, however, have folded their wings, signalling their intent not to sing to the Many.

Instead, Many-Times-Burned, The Broken and Unbroken, mightiest of all Kin, stands ascendant, preparing to sing.

Beside it, Darktooth the Wise, the Far-Travelling Gatherer of Knowledge, and Allmother, Last of the Crystal Clan and Beloved-to-All, stand ready. It seems they also wish to be heard.

Suddenly, the gathered Kin find themselves falling quiet and turning all of their senses to great Many-Times-Burned. It need not even call for silence. Such is the power of a true Elder of the Kin.

Event: ff2b

When the quiet is smooth and unbroken, it begins.

<MTB>THE END.

<MTB>IT COMES. I HAVE SMELLED IT.

<MTB>OUR MOTHER, GREAT EARTH, IS CHANGING AS SHE HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THE SKYFALL, WHEN THE OTHERS VIOLATED HER AND USURPED OUR DOMINION.

<MTB>NOW, THE SEED LEFT BEHIND BY THE DEFILERS FESTERS AND GROWS INTO A LIVING DISEASE.

<MTB>THE TAILLESS ONES... THE FLATFACES, THE BROKEN CUSTODIANS...

<MTB>THEY SHALL BE THE END.

<MTB>I HAVE TORN AWAY THE VEIL OF TIME, AND I HAVE SEEN THE WORLD WHICH THE NO-TAILS SHALL CREATE.

<MTB>GONE SHALL BE THE GREAT GREEN AND THE GREAT BLUE BOTH.

<MTB>INSTEAD, THEY SHALL BIRTH A GREAT GREY, WHICH SHALL COVER THE LAND, THE WATERS, EVEN THE SKIES ABOVE.

<MTB>COUNTLESS GOODBEASTS SHALL PERISH IN CONFUSION, NOT HUNTED FAIRLY BUT TRAPPED, DECEIVED, EVEN ENSLAVED.

<MTB>MANY SONGS, EVEN THE SONGS OF WHOLE PEOPLES AND TRIBES OF GOODBEASTS, SHALL BE STILLED, NEVER TO RISE AGAIN.

<MTB>HEAR ME. OUR MUSIC... THE MUSIC OF THE DRAAK-KIN... IS AMONG THOSE WHICH SHALL BE LOST.

<MTB>TIME HAS SPOKEN. THE TAILLESS SHALL BE OUR DOOM. THE FUTURE I HAVE BEHELD IS EMPTY OF OUR KIND.

<MTB>WE SHALL BE REDUCED TO WORSE THAN NOTHING...

<MTB>A MYTH, A NEVER-WAS, WHICH THE FLATFACES WILL TELL STORIES OF TO AGGRANDIZE THEMSELVES.

<MTB>SO SHALL IT BE WITH THE DRAAK-KIN, GREATEST OF THE TRUE CHILDREN OF ABOVE AND BELOW.

<MTB>AS MORE AND MORE OF SUN AND EARTH'S TRUE CHILDREN PERISH OR ARE ENSLAVED, THERE WILL BE NONE TO STAND AGAINST THE VIOLATORS.

<MTB>THE BABBLING OF THE NO-TAILS SHALL SOUND FROM EVERY CORNER OF EARTH, FILLING THE AIR. IN THE ABSENCE OF THEIR OTHER-CREATORS, THEY SHALL LOSE THEMSELVES.

<MTB>DESCENDING INTO MADNESS AND PROFLIGACY, THEY SHALL CHOKE OUR MOTHER WITH HEAT AND WASTE. AS MORE AND MORE OF HER TRUE CHILDREN VANISH, THERE WILL BE NONE TO STAND AGAINST THEM.

<MTB>THIS IS THE <color #8a8a8a>GREY FUTURE.</color>

<darktooth>INDEED. SO IT SHALL BE.

<darktooth>ALL OF THE ELDERS HAVE TRAVELED INTO THE FUTURE, SOME THROUGH THE DREAMING, SOME THROUGH SECRET MUSICS, SOME THROUGH LOGIC AND REASON. AND ALL HAVE ARRIVED AT THE SAME RESULT.

<darktooth>EARTH, CREATOR OF US ALL, SHALL BE REDUCED TO THE DEMESNE OF BUT ONE PEOPLE, THE SEED OF THE OTHERS, WHO WILL HAVE FORGOTTEN THEIR OWN PURPOSE.

<allmother>ALONE. SUNDERED. SELF-BOUND.

<allmother>INDEED, THE TAILLESS SHALL DEVOUR THEMSELVES WITH THEIR OWN MINDS.

<allmother>IN THE END, THEIRS SHALL BE THE GREATEST SUFFERING, FOR THEY SHALL PERISH UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN THE RUIN OF ALL. THEIR EXPANSIVE MINDS SHALL NOT SPARE THEM THE DEEP KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY.

<allmother>THE HORROR... MY POOR CHILDREN ALL...

<allmother>BUT SO SHALL IT BE.

<MTB>BUT HEAR NOW MY VOICE.

<MTB>HEAR MY SONG TO ALL KIN BORN AND WHO SHALL BE BORN:

<MTB>FINAL WAR IS NOW DECLARED UPON THE NO-TAILS AND ALL OF THEIR WORKS.

<MTB>ONLY BY UNITING AND DEDICATING OURSELVES TO THIS BLESSED ACT CAN WE SAVE EARTH, WHO GAVE US LIFE AND MADE US GREAT AMONG HER CHILDREN.

<MTB>AND ONLY BY BRINGING FORTH THE SPIRIT OF FIRE HIDDEN IN US CAN WE BECOME SUN'S INSTRUMENTS IN CLEANSING THIS FUTURE FROM REALITY.

<MTB>THE TAILLESS ARE YET WEAK ENOUGH THAT WE MAY EXTINGUISH THE FLAME.

<MTB>BUT THEY MULTIPLY QUICKLY. SOON, THE GREAT GREY WILL BE TOO PROBABLE TO BE UNCREATED.

<MTB>UNTIL SUN BEHOLDS EARTH FREE FROM THE TAINT OF ALL OTHER-SEED...

<MTB>WE MUST BECOME WARRIORS ALL, AND SLAY EVERY TAILLESS WHICH DRAWS BREATH, EVEN TO THE LAST HATCHLING.

<MTB>NO KIN SHALL LEAVE THIS GATHERING WITHOUT SWEARING A BINDING OATH:

<MTB>YOU SHALL NOT SUFFER A FLATFACE TO LIVE, AND SHALL NEVER KNOW PEACE UNTIL THE THREAT IS FOREVER GONE AND THE SHALL-BE CHANGED.

<MTB>SUCH IS NECESSITY'S DEMAND. SO IT IS, AND SHALL BE. THIS SUN, THE GREAT CLEANSING OF EARTH BEGINS.

The accumulated Draak-Kin are astounded.

Can the naked, spiritblind Tailless really be such a threat? What dreadful Music could give them such power over Reality?

And to intentionally hunt a species to Final Destruction...

Such has never been done, nor has an Elder forced its own Way upon other Kin since the rise of the Ruiner-Empress.

But if the other Elders offer no challenge to this revelation, then it must be true.

In the glances, the shivering of tails and the raising of feathers, you can sense the immense disquiet of the Kin.

<darktooth>WAIT, MY KIN. THERE IS A SECOND WAY.

<darktooth>THOUGH THE ELDERS HAVE ALL SEEN THE SAME GREY FUTURE...

<darktooth>AND ALL AGREE THAT ACTION MUST BE TAKEN...

<darktooth>NOT ALL BELIEVE THAT THE PATH OF FIRE, THE WAY OF DESTRUCTION, SHALL AVAIL US.

<darktooth>BEHOLD: I BRING YOU A VISION.

<darktooth>DEEP, DEEP IN THE STAR-PIERCED VOID, THERE IS ANOTHER SUN...

<darktooth>AND ANOTHER EARTH.

<darktooth>THERE, GOODBEASTS UNLIKE ANY KNOWN TO US DANCE AND SING. THE AIR IS SWEET, PREY IS PLENTIFUL, AND TREASURES UNIMAGINABLE ARE FORGED.

<darktooth>I HAVE BEEN THERE. I HAVE TASTED ITS FLESH, SMELLED ITS SKIN. I HAVE NAMED THIS WORLD...

<darktooth><bold>NEWHOME.</bold>

<darktooth>ACROSS THE TURNINGS-BY-THOUSANDS, I HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF HOW TO WALK AMONG THE STARS, TO FLY IN THE COMPANY OF SUN'S BRETHREN.

<darktooth>TO THOSE WITH THE WORTH TO SEED A NEW WORLD AND THE WISDOM TO TURN AWAY FROM THE PATH OF DESTRUCTION, I OFFER THIS ALTERNATIVE.

<darktooth>A WORLD NEW TO OUR KIND, WITH VAST LANDS AND DEEP SEAS. NEW SECRETS. NEW TRUTHS. NEW SONGS, NEW MUSIC.

<darktooth>A WORLD FREE FROM THE FELL OTHERS, AND CLEAN OF THEIR SEED.

<darktooth>FOR NEW DISCOVERIES, MY MIND, EVEN MY ESSENCE, HAVE LONG HUNGERED.

<darktooth>IF THE UNKNOWN CALLS TO ANY OF THE GREAT KIN BEFORE ME... COME AWAY WITH ME.

<darktooth>WE SHALL ENDURE, AND OUR PEOPLE SHALL HAVE A NEW BEGINNING, AND NEW PLEASURES AND PAINS BOTH IN ABUNDANCE.

<darktooth>WE SHALL GROW MIGHTIER THAN WE ONCE IMAGINED.

<darktooth>IT WILL TAKE MUCH SHINESTONE, AND MANY NEW KNOWLEDGES AND PATHS MUST BE UNDERTAKEN, BUT WE SHALL ENDURE, FAR BEYOND THE REACH OF THE TAILLESS.

<MTB>THE DARK-TOOTHED FAR-SCHOLAR WOULD ABANDON EARTH IN HER TIME OF GREATEST NEED.

<MTB>I AM NOT INTERESTED IN STOPPING ITS EGRESS. DESTROYING THE TAILLESS WILL BE EASIER IN ITS ABSENCE.

<MTB>LET IT CHASE ITS DESIRE FOR NOVELTY INTO THE VOID AND BE GONE. BUT ANY WHO DARE TO FOLLOW WILL FACE MY WRATH.

<MTB>EVERY CLAW, EVERY FANG, OF OUR PEOPLE WILL BE NEEDED FOR THE GREAT CLEANSING.

<MTB>WE STAND AGAINST TIME ITSELF. THIS IS NO TIME FOR SHALLOW FANTASIES.

<darktooth>MY WAY IS NEITHER SHALLOW NOR FANTASTICAL.

<darktooth>WITH ENOUGH SHINESTONE, A GREAT CONTAINER TO CARRY US TO NEWHOME CAN BE BUILT. SO I SWEAR.

<darktooth>AND IT IS THE ONLY PATH WHICH ENSURES THAT, EVEN IF EARTH FALLS, OUR PEOPLE AND OUR MUSIC SHALL NOT PERISH FROM THE ONESONG.

<darktooth>DESPITE YOUR MIGHTY WILL, DEEPFLAME, HONORED RIVAL... DESPITE YOUR RESOLUTION TO DESTROY THE TAILLESS...

<darktooth>THE FUTURE WE ELDERS SEE DOES NOT CHANGE.

<darktooth>IT MAY EVEN BE THAT YOUR GREAT CLEANSING SHALL HASTEN THE ANNIHILATION OF THE KIN AS A RACE.

<MTB>YOU DARE...?

<allmother>IN THIS, I ECHO MIGHTY MANY-TIMES-BURNED, WISE DARKTOOTH; SUCH AN ACTION IS A DESERTION OF LOVING MOTHER EARTH, AND OUR MANY RELATIONS WHICH FEED FROM HER.

<allmother>THERE ARE THOSE OF US WHO LOVE EARTH AND SUN SUCH THAT NONE OF THEIR INFINITE SIBLINGS WOULD BRING PEACE TO OUR SOULS.

<allmother>TO LOOK UP INTO THE GREAT ABOVE AND SEE A BLAZING GLORY THAT IS NOT HE WHO HAS WATCHED OVER US FOR ALL TIME...

<allmother>CAN SUCH A THING BE ENDURED? ARE NOT OUR VERY ESSENCES BOUND TO THE GREEN, THE BLUE, THE ABOVE AND THE BELOW OF THIS WORLD?

<allmother>INDEED, IN THE SPIRIT-WORLD, THE WORLD OF ESSENCE, INVISIBLE TO THE NO-TAILS, OUR TRUE SALVATION MAY LIE.

<allmother>LIKE DARKTOOTH, I QUESTION WHETHER THE GREAT CLEANSING WILL HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE TIME ITSELF.

<allmother>AND LIKE MIGHTY MANY-TIMES-BURNED, I LOVE MY TRUE MOTHER, EARTH, WITH ALL MY MIND AND ALL MY CORE AND ALL MY ESSENCE, AND WILL NOT ABANDON HER, NOT EVER.

<allmother>I THEREFORE OFFER A THIRD WAY.

<allmother>THE TAILLESS... CAN BE REDEEMED.

<allmother>BEYOND THE GREY-TO-COME, THE GREAT GREEN AND THE GREAT BLUE CAN RISE AGAIN.

<allmother>NOTHING CAN STOP THE DESOLATION. FATE IS FIXED AND IMMUTABLE. BUT WE CAN JOIN WITH THE TAILLESS. TEACH THEM. GUIDE THEM.

<allmother>WE CAN DO THIS ONLY ONE WAY...

<allmother>BY BECOMING THEM.

Unrest. Confusion.

All know that it is impossible for one kind of being to become another.

<allmother>IF ONE HAS TRULY GREAT STRENGTH OF ESSENCE, AND DEEPLY DESIRES IT...

<allmother>WE CAN MERGE WITH HUMANITY.

<allmother>WE CAN INVEST THEM WITH PARTS OF OUR SOULS, AS WE HAVE DONE WITH MANY GOODBEASTS OVER TIME.

<allmother>DUE TO THEIR ALIEN NATURE, A SIMPLE FRAGMENT WILL NOT SUFFICE. BUT IF WE EMBRACE THE COMING DESTRUCTION WITH COMPASSION AND TRUTH...

<allmother>IF WE ABANDON THESE MIGHTY FORMS, BUT SING TRUE THROUGH THE INWARD WAYS, AND CONTINUE TO LOVE...

<allmother>IN THE FAR FUTURE, NO-TAILS MAY BE BORN WITH DRAAK-KIN SOULS, CAPABLE OF SINGING WITH OUR VOICES, SEEING WITH OUR EYES.

<allmother>THOSE TAILLESS DRAAK-KIN OF THE FUTURE ARE THE GREATEST HOPE OF SALVATION FOR EARTH AND ALL WHO LIVE UPON HER.

<allmother>THEY... WE... SHALL GUIDE THEM FROM THE GREY TO THE BLUE AND THE GREEN. A NEW DAWN AGAINST THE TWILIGHT.

<allmother>TO MAKE THIS A REALITY, I SHALL SOON LEAVE THIS BODY AND INVEST MY ESSENCE IN THE OTHER-SEED. I SHALL PERISH...

<allmother>BUT MY ESSENCE WILL BE REBORN, TO GUIDE THE TAILLESS ORPHANS TO LASTING PEACE AND THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES.

<allmother>WILL NONE OF YOU JOIN ME ON THIS THIRD WAY, THE WAY OF COMPASSION?

<allmother>WILL NONE OF YOU EMBRACE THE COMING DARKNESS TO BRING A FINAL LIGHT?

<darktooth>YOU ASK IF A TRUE AND NOBLE KIN WILL JOIN YOU IN PERISHING IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL SOMEHOW BE REBORN AS A FLATFACE IN A GREY WORLD WITHOUT THE KIN?

<darktooth>IN ALL THE LORE OF OUR PEOPLE, NO TWO PEOPLES HAVE EVER UNITED IN SUCH A WAY. DRAAK ESSENCE IS FOR DRAAK FLESH. COULD A TAILLESS BODY EVEN CONTAIN IT?

<darktooth>THIS HAS A VERY LOW CHANCE OF SUCCESS. LOGIC SINGS PLAINLY ON THIS MATTER.

<allmother>BUT IF OTHERS JOIN WITH ME, THE CHANCES WILL INCREASE...

<allmother>AND I HAVE COME TO... LOVE THE TAILLESS ORPHANS.

Many cannot help but ruffle their feathers at this. Some shake their heads as if to scatter water away, despite the disrespect to an elder this implies.

But that idea... <color #b57edc>love...</color> is known to be extremely dangerous, a conceit of lesser beings, to console them in their base need for each other to survive.

And to express any kind of affection for a People who are only half from this world, the produce of the Others, sworn enemies of the Draak...

<italic>Who do not even have tails...</italic>

And for a Kin to beg, especially an Elder, for anything at all...

It is unimaginable.

<allmother>JUDGE AS YOU WISH. I SHALL SOON BE GONE. THIS BODY SHALL PERISH AND I SHALL VOLUNTARILY CAST MY SPIRIT AWAY AND AHEAD.

<allmother>BUT IF THERE ARE ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE DISCOVERED THE GREATEST SECRET OF THE ONESONG...

<allmother>THAT ALL BEINGS, EVEN THE TAILLESS, ARE ONE, AND SHARE THE SAME ULTIMATE DESTINY...

<allmother>IF ANY OF YOU HAVE LOOKED INTO THEIR MINDS AND SEEN THE INCREDIBLE WONDERS OF WHICH THEY ARE CAPABLE...

<allmother>AND IF ANY OF YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE DRAAK IS NOT A STATE OF BODY, BUT A STATE OF ESSENCE...

<allmother>I BEG OF YOU. JOIN ME.

<allmother>SAVE THE ORPHANS, AND OUR WORLD ALONG WITH THEM.

<MTB>BLASPHEMY. MADNESS.

<MTB>YOUR STRATEGY ASSUMES THE FAILURE OF THE GREAT CLEANSING AND JOINS US WITH THE MOST RUINOUS AND DEGENERATE ENTITY EVER TO APPEAR ON OUR MOTHER'S HOLY BODY.

<MTB>NO TRUE KIN WOULD WANT SUCH A THING, LET ALONE EMBRACE CERTAIN DESTRUCTION FOR IT.

<allmother>THE ORPHANS... THE NO-TAILS... DID NOT CHOOSE TO BE CREATED.

<allmother>THEY ARE LOST AND CONFUSED. HALF-OTHER, HALF-GOODBEAST.

<allmother>THEIR DEEPEST WISH IS NOT TO DESTROY US AND TAINT THIS WORLD, BUT ONLY TO BE LOVED. TO KNOW THEIR TRUE PURPOSE, THEIR TRUE IDENTITY AS CHILDREN OF THE STARS.

<allmother>THEY ARE DESERVING OF OUR PITY, AND OUR COMPASSION, MORE THAN ANY GOODBEAST WHOSE WAY IS STRAIGHT AND SURE AND KNOWN.

<darktooth>NEVERTHELESS, I KNOW MUCH OF THE DISPERSION AND ACCUMULATION OF ESSENCE, AND THE SELF-SACRIFICE YOU ENDORSE IS UNWISE.

<darktooth>THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT YOUR ESSENCE WILL NOT BE ABSORBED BY A GREATER FORCE, OR DISSIPATED, OR ENTER THE WRONG KIND OF BODY.

<darktooth>IT WOULD TAKE AN ACT OF WILL ON PAR WITH THE GREATEST ACTIONS EVER TAKEN BY THE MOST STRONG-SOULED OF THE DRAAK TO FULFILL YOUR DESIRE.

<darktooth>PERHAPS YOU, BELOVED-OF-ALL, ARE MIGHTY ENOUGH IN SPIRIT, BUT YOU ARE AN ELDER. YOUNGER DRAAK WHO FOLLOW YOU MAY WELL PERISH FRUITLESSLY.

<allmother>TRUE COMPASSION IS BEYOND ALL OF YOUR LOGIC, WISE ONE. I BELIEVE, IN THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART, THAT WE CAN MERGE OUR PEOPLES AND SAVE ALL.

<allmother>THERE IS MORE OF OUR MUSIC, AND THAT OF THE ONESONG, IN THE NO-TAILS THAN YOU KNOW.

<MTB>ENOUGH. I WILL HEAR NOT ONE SONG-NOTE MORE OF THIS SEDITION.

<MTB>THESE TWO ADVOCATE ESCAPE, OR JOINING WITH THE ENEMY.

<MTB>THEY ARE ELDERS, STRONG IN MANY PATHS. THEY SHALL DO AS THEY DESIRE.

<MTB>BUT I WILL ALLOW NO OTHER DRAAK-KIN TO FOLLOW THEM INTO DELUSION. EARTH NEEDS THE KIN NOW AS SHE HAS NEVER NEEDED HER CHILDREN BEFORE.

<MTB>WE MUST DO AS WE WERE MADE TO DO: DESTROY. WITH THESE CLAWS, THESE FANGS, THIS BREATH OF FIRE WHICH SUN AND EARTH HAVE GIVEN US.

<MTB>WE MUST STOP THE GREY FUTURE FROM OCCURRING. JOIN WITH ME, AND SAVE THAT WHICH WE LOVE.

<MTB>SAVE OUR RELATIONS, THE GOODBEASTS, WHO SHALL BE VICTIMS OF OUR INACTION IF WE DELAY OR RECOIL FROM THIS SACRED DUTY.

<MTB>LET THE BLUE BE FOREVER BLUE, THE GREEN FOREVER GREEN.

<MTB>THE TRUTH AND THE JUSTICE AND THE GLORY LIE WITH ME.

<MTB>WE SHALL WALK IN CRIMSON BEAUTY ALONG THIS PATH, OR WE SHALL PERISH. I HAVE SUNG. SO IT IS, AND SHALL BE.

<darktooth>LET US THEN ASK ONE NEWLY-FORGED.

<darktooth>YOU. KEEPER OF THE SPIRITWOOD.

Suddenly, you feel the senses of all of the Kin upon you.

What is happening? Why have you been singled out?

<darktooth>YOU ARE YOUNG, BUT YOU HAVE LIVED CLOSEST TO THE SPIRIT OF THE GREAT GREEN.

<darktooth>ITS WISDOM IS BEYOND ALL OF OURS. IT HAS BEEN SINCE BEFORE THE SKYFALL, BEFORE EVEN THE VERY FIRST KIN.

<darktooth>EACH ACTION, EACH DISCOVERY, EACH SUN HAS BEEN A LESSON TO YOU FROM THE SPIRIT OF THE GREAT GREEN.

Some wish to journey with Darktooth, but when it becomes clear that doing so would bring Many-Times-Burned's immortal wrath upon them, few are able to earn exemption.

A mere few join with Allmother, and they are swiftly destroyed. Only Time will tell whether their sacrifice had any meaning.

And so the Great Cleansing begins...

<darktooth>AND SO THE CHOICE IS MADE.

<darktooth>LONG HAVE I WATCHED, SMELLED THIS YOUNG KIN, THIS KEEPER OF THE SPIRITWOOD.

<darktooth>IT WAS BUT A TINY HATCHLING WHEN WE FIRST ENCOUNTERED EACH OTHER.

<darktooth>BUT WITH EVERY SUN...

<darktooth>EVERY TURNING...

<darktooth>IT HAS GROWN STRONGER, IN MIND, BODY, AND EVEN ESSENCE.

<darktooth>TO SEE MY OWN SEED, MY HALF-CREATION, FLOURISHING AS IT HAS DONE...

<darktooth>TO HEAR AND TASTE OF ITS GREAT DEEDS AS WHISPERED BY THE WINDS AND LESSER GOODBEASTS...

<darktooth>MY CORE IS ALIGHT WITH PRIDE, AND MY MIND DANCES AND BURNS, AWAKE TO A NEW FUTURE.

<darktooth>THE ONESONG IS VAST INDEED, AND ALL KNOWLEDGE OF IT APPROACHES NULL.

<darktooth>HOWEVER...

<darktooth>THERE ARE FEW SUCH AS THIS YOUNG KIN WITHIN IT.

<darktooth>A DESIRE HAS AWAKENED IN MY BREAST...

<darktooth>A DESIRE TO BRING THIS ONE TO NEWHOME.

<darktooth>ITS PROVEN STRENGTH, ITS BUDDING WISDOM, ITS COURAGE AND SKILL...

<darktooth>THEY SHALL ENSURE THAT THE DRAAK-KIN SHALL THRIVE IN A NEW WORLD.

<darktooth>I ACCEPT. TOGETHER, WE SHALL DEFEAT THE VOID.

<darktooth>SUCH IS MY SONG TO A YOUNG KIN.

<darktooth>INDEED?

<darktooth>IF WE ARE TO BE REBORN AS A PEOPLE IN A NEW WORLD...

<darktooth>THEN ONLY THE WISE OR THE MIGHTY SHALL BE WORTHY TO PLANT THIS NEW DRAAK-SEED WITHIN THE COSMOS.

<darktooth>IS YOUR WISDOM, YOUR STRENGTH, GREAT ENOUGH TO FORGE A NEW BEGINNING, O YOUNG KIN?

<darktooth>IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR NATURE AND TRADITION BOTH...

<darktooth>YOUR TROVE SHALL SING THE TRUTH.

<darktooth>THE VOID-VESSEL, WROUGHT FROM SHINESTONE AND GEMS, SHALL BE VAST. A GREAT DEAL OF MATERIAL WILL BE NECESSARY.

<darktooth>HAVE YOU ENOUGH TO COMPLETE THE BUILDING-LABOR?

<darktooth>COULD A YOUNG KIN BE SO WEALTHY? OR HAS IT OUGHT ELSE TO OFFER?

<darktooth>SUCH ARE THOSE WHO SHALL THRIVE WHEN OUR SEED IS PLANTED IN FAR-SOIL.

You hold aloft the Silver Rod given to you by Darktooth for completing the journey of Wisdom.

In its Awakened state, it projects rotating spheres and spirals, painting them in emerald light on the cold air.

Darktooth's gaze does not waver, but its tail curls and brushes the ground.

<darktooth>AND SO IT IS FULFILLED. HOPE WAS NOT ENKINDLED IN VAIN.

<darktooth>THE NAVIGATIONAL ROD... I HAD HOPED A CERTAIN YOUNG KIN WOULD UNLOCK ITS POWER.

<darktooth>WITH IT, THE SUCCESS OF THE FAR-JOURNEY IS ASSURED.

<darktooth>I FIND YOU MOST WORTHY, MY CREATION.

<darktooth>IT SEEMS AS THOUGH SOMETHING HAS BEEN OFFERED WORTHY OF A GRAND TRANSACTION, O MY CREATION.

<darktooth>WITH THIS, PASSAGE IS PURCHASED TO A NEW REALITY.

Suddenly, there is complete and utter silence.

Every Draak-Kin gathered dares not move.

Even Darktooth and Allmother seem completely stunned. It is not easy to cause a being of thousands of Turnings to be surprised, but you have managed it.

Many-Times-Burned shifts its weight forward, very slightly. The crunching of ice and rock under its claws is soft, but seems deafening amidst the silence.

<MTB>YOUR STRENGTH IS NEEDED.

<MTB>I WILL THEREFORE EXTEND ONE CHANCE FOR YOU TO SUBMIT, AND SURVIVE.

You hold forth the mysterious elixir crafted by the No-Tail Artist.

<MTB>NO...

<MTB>NO!

<MTB>I RELEASE YOU FROM YOUR OBLIGATION.

<MTB>DO NOT COME CLOSE TO ME WITH THAT.

Most of the Kin gathered are flabbergasted. Great Many-Times-Burned, afraid?

The one who sundered Time, and became one with the Great Mother herself in her very uttermost Core? Who could topple a mountain with barely a thought?

<darktooth>THE YOUNG ONE CANNOT KNOW.

<darktooth>CANNOT KNOW WHAT GREAT MANY-TIMES-BURNED HAS SACRIFICED.

<darktooth>TO MAKE THE BROKEN ONE WHOLE AGAIN...

Darktooth glances over to Fathom, and then sings.

<darktooth>PUT IT TO YOUR EAR, THEN, MIGHTY ONE. SURELY, IT HAS NOTHING TO TEACH ONE SO POWERFUL.

Many-Times-Burned holds the Living Labyrinth close...

And its spines suddenly puff out in shock.

Suddenly, a wave of power and light spills forth from Darktooth in an incredible Song.

It is a True Song, but not one of which you have ever heard.

<darktooth>WATER. COOL. CLEAR. FLOWING.

<darktooth>FIRE-EXTINGUISHING.

<darktooth>WATER FLOWS OVER THE FIRE.

<darktooth>THE DEPTHS BECOME THE VOID.

<darktooth>THE VOID BECOMES THE DREAMING.

<darktooth>PEACE. PEACE. PEACE.

The assembled Kin are lulled nearly into unconsciousness by the True Song...

Except for great Many-Times-Burned, who is still quite alert.

The flame of wrath is gone from its eyes, however. It looks to Darktooth, and then to you, and finally turns away.

<MTB>IT SEEMS THIS YOUNG ONE IS NOT WORTH MY EFFORT.

<MTB>BEGONE. THIS WORLD IS NO LONGER YOUR HOME.

The True Song of Destruction.

Enlightenment of Fire, Soul of Unmaking in the Onesong.

To be subjected to it is certain doom. Many-Times-Burned's mastery of it, forged through ages, is so great its power can be amplified and focused upon a single hearer... you.

Not only your Body, but your very Essence shall be annihilated by it.

Unless...

Event: ff2fbdca2a

The power swirls about you..

It enters your mouth, your eyes, every pore of your hide, seeking to unMake you...

But you hold part of the very Body of the one who sings against you: the Darkspine.

You proved yourself a warrior of great strength in the Elder's very Lair, and it gave you the gift of part of itself.

That part, which has survived unspeakable trials, now resists the Dread-Song in your stead.

The assembled Draak hiss in surprise, attempting to fathom how you might be unharmed by such a Song.

<MTB>SO. YOU UNLOCKED ITS SECRET.

<MTB>I AM THWARTED AGAIN BY EVIL GENEROSITY.

<MTB>BURNED ONCE MORE AM I. ONCE MORE.

<MTB>THAT TRUE SONG WAS NOT BY ANY MEANS MY ONLY RESORT.

<MTB>I COULD DESTROY THIS YOUNG KIN BY A THOUSAND MEANS RIGHT NOW AGAINST WHICH THE DARKSPINE WOULD BE OF NO AVAIL.

<MTB>HOWEVER...

<MTB>IT SEEMS I WAS MISTAKEN.

Against the Unmaking, you raise your voice in beautiful Song.

It is a True Song, a song of Healing, of Mending.

The other Draak-Kin back away from you as you dare to contend with the Undestroyed Destroyer.

The sounds clash, writhing, a Dance against each other unlike any witnessed before.

But Earth... great Earth, who birthed all, even Many-Times-Burned, in Her incredible Way...

Earth's True Song cannot be unmade by the will of the Great Elder.

Slowly, it gains supremacy. Other Kin stamp and roar in disbelief, but you cannot hear them.

All you can hear is the True Song of Healing, Earth's Enlightenment, which holds you in existence like a Star shining in the cold, deadly Void.

It is over. And you are whole. Untouched.

You allow the song to fade, and stretch your beautiful wings outwards in a signal of victory.

<allmother>IMPOSSIBLE. CAN ONE SO YOUNG TRULY KNOW THAT BLESSED SONG...

<allmother>THE TRUE SONG OF HEALING?

<darktooth>THE FLAME...

<darktooth>THE FLAME IS BESTED.

<MTB>A GROSS EXAGGERATION. IT BUT COUNTERED ONE SMALL SONG.

<MTB>I COULD DESTROY THIS YOUNG KIN BY A THOUSAND MEANS RIGHT NOW AGAINST WHICH THAT TRUE SONG WOULD BE OF NO AVAIL.

<MTB>HOWEVER...

But your Mind need not hold such Truths. Only your Body.

With great determination and a curse against your enemies, the No-Tails, who pollute Earth with their unclean, alien presence...

You drive the great quill into your flesh.

A tiny portion of great Many-Times-Burned's power enters into you. Your feathers are aflame. Your Mind becomes charcoal, and then diamond.

You become Sun Himself touching down, blasting the ground clean of all things with your endless glory.

<color #b54141><italic>Consume... consume... take them all in... make them all light, and heat... purify...</color></italic>

It is done.

Nothing remains of that place. Nothing at all.

In time, perhaps you could call such Music as this your own permanently...

But for now, your bravery and strength earned you a taste of the true power of a thrice-enlightened Elder of Fire, and you will never forget.

Event: ff3cd

Flying over the No-Tail Hive, you might pause to reflect on how you arrived at this point, holding a crime against the Onesong about to be used for Good.

When you were but a hatchling, you did what others could not and found the False Face of the Delvers hidden deep below Heartbone Valley.

Like a true Draak-Kin, you kept it, guarded it, watching, waiting, then traded it back to the Delvers for great wealth, and even pressed them into giving you this. They probably did not even know what it was themselves, fortunately.

And now, the time has come. You drop the @#$% through the quiet night Air...

The horror.

The glory.

Everything is wiped away. Everything with the rhythm of Life in it, from the No-Tails to the tiny blades of Grass swaying in the wind.

But out of this Destruction will come new Life, you know. Slowly, the Green will creep back into this place and fill it with itself.

In a bare hundred Turnings, nobeast will even remember that this place was once a No-Tail Hive. It will be healthy, and one with the Green.

It is done. You have triumphed.

Event: ff3s

The Great Cleansing proves to be far more complicated than any could have anticipated. It may be long before final victory is achieved...

But for now, you have purged the Spiritwood clean of the No-Tails' existence.

No longer are Goodbeasts trapped and enslaved. The rivers flow clear, and the soil is good and pure.

Here, you are hailed as savior, guardian and deity to all of the children of Nature.

Predator and prey alike praise you, for you have proven yourself a protector of the greater power of Life.

Your Body and Trove grow steadily. Draak come from far and wide, hoping to partake in the Dance of Creation with you, knowing your offspring will be strong and pure and fearless, as you are.

As Sun and Earth roll on, you find a place of wealth and fulfillment in the blessed Great Green...

And its Spirit smiles upon you, and upon a Land clean of pollution and corruption.

So ends the tale of your childhood. What began as a tiny voice inside a small buried Chamber far away...

Has now become a strong-tailed, sharp-clawed Draak, sovereign over countless Goodbeasts.

You are the Wild. You are Nature, Above and Below, made flesh...

You are <italic><bold>Kin.</italic></bold>

And many shall be the tales of your adventures, your acquisitions, romances and discoveries as an adult...

But those are different tales.

Rest now, and when you feel ready, return again...

For you have lived many lives as one of the Draak-Kin, and not all of them ended this way, and yet all of those endings were important and true.

May you be blessed.

So it was that you proved yourself worthy of the greatest journey, the greatest migration, ever known or attempted by the Kin.

While the Great Cleansing begins above, you join Darktooth and several other wise Draak in the construction of a vessel which could fall upwards through the neverending Void.

Many Moon-times and an unthinkable amount of Treasure are required...

But at the last, it is complete, and the Journey begun.

Inside the vessel, sealed in a new, freezing Chamber... a second-Chamber of shinestone, strange fluids and dead Time...

You know not the passing of distance, or moments.

It is another Great Sleep, a final hibernation, unexpected but necessary.

And then, at last, at long last, heat and thought creeps back into your vast and perfect Body.

The Last Wall falls away...

And you had arrived.

<bold>Newhome.</bold> A new, adoptive Mother, fertile and ready beneath your claws.

A new Great Father blazes above, with two Sisters nearby, reflecting His carnelian light.

In this world, you and your descendants shall become mighty.

Will you be like the Others who tainted Earth, and force all to bend to your kind? Will this precious sphere be poorer for your coming?

Or will you show greater Wisdom, greater Compassion, and become part of this place, woven elegantly into its wonders and mysteries, High Guardian of a New Earth?

Many shall be the tales of your adventures, your acquisitions, romances and discoveries as an adult in this new reality...

But those are different tales. This story, the story of your childhood in the Great Green, is over.

Perhaps you lived other childhoods, other lives as a Draak long ago.

Perhaps, one day, you shall discover other truths, other endings to your beginning.

Until then...

May you be blessed.

It is very dark.

Are you... lost?

Did you forget your way?

Did you forget what you truly are?

What are you?

Event: ff5a

Compassion...

The deep knowledge... no, the experience...

Of the Great Oneness.

Everything which lives, which even exists...

It is all part of the same whole. The same Essence. The same true unity.

You are a Guardian...

A True Child of Above and Below, Kin to the mightiest beings this sphere has ever known.

You know that the Great Cleansing was always doomed to fail. The Tailless are stronger than the Elders could have known, save one.

Many-Times-Burned and all of the others are gone. Time beyond measure has passed, and Earth cries out as the No-Tails, alone and afraid, abuse Her.

But you will save them. Not only Earth, but the No-Tails as well...

For you are DRAAK-KIN.

And YOU WILL SAVE THIS WORLD.

At last, you feel a pull, a call to physical reality, like many you have felt since your Body perished millennia ago...

But this is, at last, the one you were waiting for.

Tumbling downwards and inside...

A new story, the last story, now begins.

Event: ff5b

You remember now. The Tailless... no.

They call themselves...

Human beings.

They have no scales, nor feathers.

No sharp claws nor wings. Only a few patches of hair to cover their ungainly forms.

But the power of Earth and Sun is in them, and something strange and wonderful as well, which originates behind the stars.

In Body, even in Mind...

You shall be one of them, the New Guardians and Rulers of Earth...

But in Essence, you always have been, and always will be...

DRAAK-KIN.

Event: ff5cf

You try to remember your true self, your Draak nature, your desire to save a lost and lonely planet...

But as the centuries, the millennia roll on, your Essence, alone in the outer darkness, forgets the truth.

You are pulled downwards into a time and a Body which is not the one you intended.

You begin a new Life, and as you are no longer truly Draak...

That story cannot be told here.

May you be blessed.

==============================
Event: ff5cs

Your connection to Compassion is not strong, neither do you deeply understand the species which you are attempting to merge with...

But you are mighty in the understanding of the hidden and subtle forces of the Onesong.

Water, sweet Water, has taught you how to spread, how to flow, how to take on new forms without losing yourself...

Just as Water does.

You are a Guardian...

A True Child of Above and Below, Kin to the mightiest beings this sphere has ever known.

You know that the Great Cleansing was always doomed to fail. The Tailless are stronger than the Elders could have known, save one.

Many-Times-Burned and all of the others are gone. Time beyond counting has passed, and Earth cries out as the No-Tails abuse Her.

But you will save them. Not only Earth, but the No-Tails as well...

For you are DRAAK-KIN.

And YOU WILL SAVE THIS WORLD.

At last, you feel a pull, like many you have felt since your Body perished millennia ago...

This is the story.

This is the story of a being who was born into a grey and desperate world...

A human with the spirit of a True Draak-Kin.

It is your story. A story which only you can tell.

Never forget what you truly are...

And wherever you go, whatever you become, as long as Compassion lives in your heart...

May you be blessed.
