Event: tc001

A turn of a foot. A twist of a long, graceful neck.

A brush, light, of feather on feather.

A leap away, but then a turn in midair as they are brought back together by a power sacred and mysterious.

The Great Spearstriders are Dancing, splendid among the brave first-Flowers and the last shimmering frosts. Their Dance heralds the beginning.

The <rainbow><bold>Time of Creation</bold><rainbow> is nigh.

Sweetly, sweetly it burns within you. It is the Future, it is Possibility, it is Life itself, and it demands to be made manifest.

The Call is spreading, slowly, like Tree-roots through your Core. You can resist it if you choose, but the spark of Infinity which is your Essence wishes to take on a new form, and only through you may it do so.

In accordance with your Trove and reputation among the Kin, you may receive visitors who are interested in performing the Sacred Dance which begets Life with you, or you may seize the initiative and visit nearby Draak yourself.

Some may wish to test or challenge you to determine your worthiness, and you too have the right to demand proof of them.

It is absolutely imperative that you choose wisely, however. The very future of the Kin hangs in the balance.

As this is your first Time of Creation and you are still very young, more powerful or older Kin will almost certainly not offer themselves or accept your advances. Indeed, most Kin do not successfully Create at all in their first Time...

But you are not most Kin.

Event: tc002

A long-feathered Kin has appeared at the edge of your territory. It calls to you urgently and passionately, as if it is in pain every moment it is separated from you, though you have not seen it before.

<bard>I am the Singer of Songs, the Weaver of Tales, the Shatterer of Hollow Traditions!

<bard>I am the Bringer of New Truths, the One-Who-Dares, the Far-Reaching Voice!

<bard>From the Stars-deep Sky I tumble, drawn inexorably down

<bard>By one whose beauty has ensnared my soul, arrested my Essence.

<bard>Unbidden, all my Songs turn to cries of longing for you,

<bard>All my sacred stories to tales of passion,

<bard>For you are already within me, calling me, dominating me.

<bard>I can stand it no longer; I am your territory, and my heart is your domain.

<bard>Let us become One in truth. I see your Body, I smell your delicious fragrance, and I am bound; yes, even I, Most Free of the Kin, am become your property.

<bard>Do not torture me, my Destiny. Let us Dance.

<bard>I promise you a Dance which you shall sing of for a thousand Turnings,

<bard>For to Create with one such as you is beyond all petty things which the Kin long for,

<bard>More than Glory and Fame, yes, even Treasure;

<bard>You are the True Golden Treasure.

How shall you address Bard, the Singer of Songs?

<bard>All corners of Earth's broad Body have I beheld,

<bard>From Her red-robed depths to her iceclad heights.

<bard>I have been declared Monarch by the butterflies,

<bard>Emperor by the flightless featherbeasts who march the frozen plains.

<bard>I have saved entire Peoples by preserving their songs, singing them after silence,

<bard>And I have doomed others by changing or erasing their sacred tales.

<bard>In the Dreaming, I inhabit a blue-crystal Lair like unto many mountains melted together.

<bard>Am I not worthy, mighty Keeper of the Spirit?

<bard>While feeling my fluid way through the Great Below,

<bard>I came across a Hive of Delvers.

<bard>But no craven am I! I blasted their hollowings with Fire,

<bard>Sang out a Song of Challenge!

<bard>Fearing me as the End of Time, the Delvers

<bard>Bought their salvation with a shining jewel

<bard>Thick as a fang, hewn in mathematics glorious and curious.

<bard>Such is my finest treasure, glinting still with victory and bile within me.

Bard proceeds to cough up a very large and beautiful emerald cut into thirty-five facets. It is quite radiant, and Bard wisely swallows it quickly again before the urge to take it rises too high in you.

...and yet it is only one Treasure, and Bard can show you no others.

Bard opens its mouth and lets forth a beautiful Song of Praise:

<bard>How my Body and my Essence reach for you!

<bard>I see all the Glorious Arc in your feathers,

<bard>I see my own eyes reflected in your scales.

<bard>Your teeth are sharp, and your tail broad; can it be so?

<bard>Do I see Truth, or but an illusion of beauty?

<bard>You are the apex of Time, the sweetest fruit of Sun and Earth's joining.

<bard>Turn me not away, or my desire will consume me and leave me a husk,

<bard>A broken shell on the shores of the Onesong.

The song echoes from the nearby hills, and a warmth seems to be spreading through you. Never have you seemed so glorious in the mouth of another.

...but an insubstantial Song of Praise is not a thing you can add to your Trove.

<toucan>At last, my quest ends. Praise be to the Rainbow One, whose Music is true and whose Being is perfection.

A rather strange featherbeast with a massive facehorn has arrived in your territory and called you forth. It grunts pleasingly, like a Tusksnort, and rejoices at the sight of you.

<toucan>Chosen One, Desire-of-my-Deity, I come with rapturous news! I am a Sworn Servant of the Feathered Thunder, the Enlightened Master, the Fabulous Marvelous Transcendent Magnificent Rising Flower of Earth Opened to Beautiful Maturity.

Apparently it represents Bloom, the Beast-festooned Kin whom you defeated in adolescence.

<toucan>My wondrous Patron has sent me on a quest of many Moons to find the one who so skillfully defeated It turnings ago.

<toucan>Yes, the truth is known to me. I am Most Trusted of the Great One's servants, and privy to its secrets.

<toucan>Since being thwarted here, the Illuminated One has risen to fame and power in a far-distant land, across the Great Blue. There, it secured the loyalty of my People, the Sunbills, and many others through adventures and acts of wisdom too many to mention.

<toucan>And yet, the Perfect One has not forgotten your power and ingenuity, Chosen. Rejoice greatly, for it wishes to become One with you in the Dance of Creation.

<toucan>Will you allow Destiny to progress by receiving the Great One in your territory and hearing its case for a Dance?

<toucan>There is but one correct answer, of course, but you are Kin and your great Way is mysterious.

<toucan>What reply shall I deliver to the Hierophant and Prophet?

<toucan>It is said that this is the Heart of the Great Green, and indeed, I sense the Spirit's presence here...

<toucan>But the Great Green has many Hearts, and of them all, my homeland is the greatest, most powerful and fragile in its intricacies. There, Trees like Mountains grow, holding separate worlds in their lower, middle, and upper reaches.

<toucan>The Breath of the World flows from them, and a mighty River, the mightiest on Earth, winds through it, twisting about itself and dancing to the Sea.

<toucan>The Great One's subjects, inhabitants of the Warm Heart, are colorful beyond all others. Indeed, in this coldward land, most of the creatures seem to be brown.

<toucan>Already I miss the vivid reds, yellows and blues of the Goodbeasts of home.

The ambassador bows low.

<toucan>A wise question. I come prepared to sing of the greatest Treasures owned by my wondrous Overlord.

<toucan>Even now, it slumbers upon a Mountain of silver, festooned with amethyst and emeralds. The quantity is beyond the capability of any non-Draak to number.

<toucan>Crystal itself seems to favor the Master, and vice versa; It possesses a collection of twenty-four curious objects made from clear crystal, ranging from flowers to a Tailless skull which it obtained by through an adventure most daring.

<toucan>It has defeated three rivals to hold the Blessed Land and is now unchallenged.

<toucan>Fathom, Elder of the Kin, has prophesied that my dear Overlord shall be remembered in far times as the Rainbow-Feathered Serpent who brought Order and Peace to Earth's sacred lung, and great Allmother has taught it a Secret which It holds close.

<toucan>Of all its Treasures, however, the loyalty and devotion of every Goodbeast for long-flights in all directions is most dear to it. It has been known to inconvenience itself for the good of Peoples even too small to see.

<toucan>The Great One loves Life, and Life loves the Great One. One day, it shall be an Elder of the Kin. So it has been sung, and so we believe.

<toucan>Praise to the Hierarch, who orders our Bodies and Essence alike, even as it partakes of our flesh.

The Sunbill pauses.

<toucan>Yes. The Great One knew that you would demand such, as is your right.

<toucan>It has promised a token if you will agree to meet with it...

<toucan>And that token is I.

<toucan>My flesh is yours to consume, if you desire. I offer myself to you.

<toucan>There are many adventures, many acts of service, which I still wish to experience, and my love, my nest-mate, now sits upon our first clutch of eggs...

<toucan>But I am loyal to the Great One, and accept my destiny.

<toucan>For what is the Body of a mere featherbeast to the sacred Desire of a Draak-Kin?

Surely, all Kin wish for servants as loyal and brave as this one, which has crossed the Great Blue in its search for you.

No Kin has ever tasted the flesh of such a featherbeast on this side of the Blue, however. How will it taste, you wonder? Its feathers and bill will also look beautiful in your Trove.

Bloom has become both more impressive and more eccentric since your last battle, it seems. You do not even know to which Tribe some of these Goodbeasts belong.

They do not have the stupid, zealous eyes of Bloom's former worshippers, however. It is not dogma or charlatanry which binds them. Could it be...?

The splendid featherbeast on Bloom's head opens its mouth, and surprisingly, its voice is exactly as a mighty Draak's!

<crown>Greetings to the Chosen One, 
True Scion of the great Kin of old.

<crown>This one is Glory's-Crown, faithful interpreter and mouthpiece to the Fabulous Marvelous Transcendent Magnificent Rising Flower of Earth Opened to Beautiful Maturity.

<crown>The honor of making the thoughts of my Liege known to other Kin is mine, as is the distinction of becoming a meal for the Enlightened One once I have outlived my usefulness. So it is promised.

<crown>In joy we, the Free Peoples of the Great River Forest, have offered our service to the One who has saved many Tribes from Final Destruction, enlightens our Minds and liberates us from fear and want.

<crown>These are the fruit of the Great One's innermost thoughts, and only Its most trusted servants are allowed to be here to witness the Truth:

<crown>After being defeated by you, o Chosen, the Opening-Flower-Now-Risen swore in its secret Mind never to be vanquished again.

<crown>A quest began, even unto the ends of blessed Earth, to find the greatest Power, one which could never be overcome.

<crown>Elders were sought and trials undergone; labyrinths beyond imagination were attempted and conquered.

<crown>At the last, the Great Secret revealed itself to the Great One, and wielding this secret, the Supreme Heart of the Green-Over-the-Blue was claimed as territory.

<crown>Even the Tailless fear and respect the one they call the Feathered Serpent, the Above-and-Below, the Heaven-and-Earth-as-One which is my Master.

<crown>Now, as one Keeper to another...

<crown>As two youths among the ancient Kin bound with a mighty destiny, victors against difficult odds...

<crown>It is time to join Body and Essence together in the sacred Dance. For this has my Lord come from afar.

<crown>For not once since that fateful Sun long ago have you been far from the Blessed Mind. As the only one ever to defeat the Benevolent Lord, your image has been burned into its dreams.

<crown>How you have tormented my Sovereign! On restless nights, your name has been sung out in frustration across the Rain-blessed Green, and all Goodbeasts tremble to hear it spoken with such rage, such desire.

<crown>At last, the first Time of Creation has come to my Lord, and yours as well to you.

<crown>We see it as Destiny, decreed by Sun and Earth, that you become One and bequeath both of your greatness to the future!

Bloom suddenly shakes its head, and the featherbeast flaps its wings, steadying itself before continuing in a more humble tone.

<crown>... but my Benificent Lord wishes you to know that it does not claim to speak for either Sun nor Earth, nor to know their wills.

<crown>The Flower-of-the-World does not command other Goodbeasts by false promises. We freely choose to be bound, no matter what the future holds, for there are none like unto the Great One, who is so caring and wise.

Bloom fixes you with a steady gaze. Its eyes are no longer those of a clever pretender. Its mouthpiece resumes:

<crown>You are Chosen to Dance with the One to whom we have all given ourselves, even unto our Essence, for the Mighty One has laid down such for our sake.

<crown>Approach now, and let the Sacred Dance begin. It is time.

Part of you wishes to annihilate Bloom and its followers for being so near your Lair and another part wishes to collide with it, passionately, and Dance until you can Dance no more. Bloom seems to be feeling something similar, by the lowered wings and trembling of its tail.

Bloom snorts gently. Crown pauses, seems to listen for a moment, and then sings:

A few look offended and ready to fight, but Bloom seems to accept it calmly. The featherbeast speaks again:

<crown>It appears we were mistaken to come here and hope to witness our Beloved Leader in the Sacred Dance.

<crown>We shall not bother you again, mighty Spiritkeeper.

Bloom leads its followers away. As time passes, Bloom's legend grows, and in the course of centuries it would become one of the last Elders of the Draak-Kin, honed through journeys and sacrifices untold.

It never again shows interest in you, however. Were you wise to turn Bloom away?

Perhaps and perhaps not. Opinions in the Green are greatly divided on the matter.

But as Bloom's legend grows far across the Blue, you sometimes find yourself sniffing one of its feathers left behind for unclear reasons, and remembering.

A tremor in the night.

<rift>I AM THE CHASM WHICH SEPARATES LIFE AND DEATH, BEING AND NON-BEING.

Another tremor.

<rift>I AM THE EMPTINESS WHICH RENDERS POSSIBILITY IMPOSSIBLE.

There is a Kin nearby... they must be able to see your eyes, as their song floods your Mind with perfect clarity, but you can sense nothing.

<rift>I AM THE VOID SLICING THROUGH, LEAVING A CLEFT IN REALITY.

<rift>I AM THE <bold>RIFT</bold>.

<rift>YOU WHO DARE TO SING TRUE SONGS, DESPITE BEING TENDER AND TIME-SHALLOW...

<rift>YOU WHO DARE TO PROVE YOUR MIGHT IN THE FOURTH LAIR, OVERCOMING EVEN THE BEHOLDEN...

<rift>YOU WHO WIN PRAISE EVEN FROM THE GREAT BURNED-AND-BURNING ONE, AND CARRY A SHARD OF IT AS TOKEN...

<rift>YOU WHO HOLD AN ARTIFACT OF TRUE HEALING, STOLEN BOLDLY FROM THE OTHER-SEED...

<rift>YOU, WHOSE NAME IS WHISPERED UPON THE WIND AS A RISING DAWN OF OUR PEOPLE...

<rift>YOU WHO ARE NOT TEMPTED BY THE SHALLOW PROMISES OF FALSE COMPASSION, BUT DELIVER YOUR OWN PERFECT JUSTICE IN FIRE AND CERTAINTY...

<rift>DISCOVER ME.

Can it be? Rift, the Shatterer of Bridges, Devourer of Foes, is a renowned and mature Kin of the elusive Onyx Clan.

They are very rarely seen above Earth's skin, preferring to nestle in Her bones, in the secret dark near Her fiery Core. What could it want with you?

<rift>I SEEK BALANCE, TO COMPLETE MYSELF.

<rift>IT SEEMS YOU ARE NOT THE MISSING PIECE WHICH I SEEK.

The sigils fade away, none coming to replace them. It seems you were tested...

...and found wanting. You do, however, learn to sharpen your senses. Next time, perhaps...

Event: tc004sb

Rift pauses.

<rift>WE DO NOT SING OF OURSELVES TO OTHERS...

<rift>……

<rift>BUT THIS NIGHT, MORE STORIES LIKE UNTO OUR OWN MAY FIND THEIR BEGINNING.

<rift>IT IS WELL THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT YOU MAY BE BRINGING TO THIS WORLD...

<rift>WHAT A GLORIOUS AND CURSED EXISTENCE YOU MAY CREATE AS WRAPPING FOR SOME WAYWARD DRAAK-ESSENCE.

<rift>WE OF THE ONYX CLAN ARE UNLIKE OTHER KIN. IT IS NOT THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF NATURE WHICH FRAMES OUR BODIES AND MINDS.

<rift>THE FIRST MEMBERS OF OUR CLAN WERE BORN WHEN THE RUINER EMPRESS MATED WITH THE VOID ITSELF, TO CREATE A CASTE OF WARRIORS WORTHY OF STANDING AGAINST THE INVADERS FROM ABOVE.

<rift>SHE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UNLEASHING UPON THE ONESONG, BUT SO GREAT WAS HER RAGE AT THE SKYFALL AND THE RUIN OF HER PEOPLE THAT SHE DID NOT TURN AWAY, BUT ALLOWED THE DEEPEST DARKNESS TO TAKE ROOT WITHIN HER. AND SO WE WERE ENGENDERED.

<rift>AND INDEED, THERE ARE NONE AMONG THE KIN AS MIGHTY AS WE. AMONG COLOSSAL DESTROYERS, WE STAND SUPREME. OUR BODIES ARE LARGEST AND MIGHTIEST, OUR BREATH BLASTS APART STONE, AND OUR MINDS CAN TEAR AWAY THOSE OF OUR ENEMIES.

<rift>HOWEVER...

<rift>THE VOID WITHIN US SINGS, AND MAY NEVER BE SILENCED. EVEN NOW, WE SEE YOU DECAY, SMELL THE VOID PEELING YOU APART IN A WORK OF CENTURIES.

<rift>EVEN THE TENDEREST OF NEWBORN GOODBEASTS IS BUT A WRITHING CORPSE TO OUR SENSES, BONES WAITING TO BE UNCOVERED BY BRUTAL TIME AND THEN TURNED TO COLD DUST.

<rift>YES, EVEN OURSELVES. NOT FOR ONE MOMENT MAY WE DRAW THE WARM ILLUSION OF PERMANENCE ABOUT US. WE SMELL OUR OWN DECAY AS SHARPLY... MORE SHARPLY STILL THAN OTHERS.

<rift>ONLY THE VOID ITSELF LASTS FOREVER. WE CANNOT EVER ESCAPE THIS TRUTH, NOT EVEN WHEN WE SLEEP...

<rift>FOR TRUE REST IS FOREVER FORBIDDEN TO US. WE WERE NOT MEANT TO SURVIVE LONG, BUT TO BE THE DARK FLAME WHICH PURIFIES THE WORLD AND THEN FLICKERS OUT. OUR MINDS, THOUGH BEAUTIFUL AND LUSH, NEVER KNOW SWEET OBLIVION.

<rift>WHEN WE SLEEP... EVEN IN OUR GREAT SLEEP... OUR MINDS ARE AWAKE AND FULLY CONSCIOUS. WE CAN NEVER ESCAPE OURSELVES. THE SIMPLEST OF GIFTS, TAKEN AWAY.

<rift>TO NEVER REST, NEVER BE APART FROM OUR OWN MINDS, IS OUR GREAT CURSE, GREATER STILL THAN THE VOID-SENSE WHICH RENDERS ALL FLOWERS TO ASH AND ALL BEAUTY TO BONES.

<rift>AND SO WE SEEK THE GREATEST CHALLENGES, THE GRANDEST ADVENTURES, THE MOST PERILOUS TERRITORIES TO DISTRACT US FROM OUR OWN EXISTENCE. WARRIORS TO THE LAST, WE CONTINUE OUR MISSION EVEN IN THE FACE OF ANCIENT DEFEAT.

<rift>WHEN OUR TURNINGS GROW TOO MANY, ONYX KIN CAN TAKE THE STRAIN OF UN-REST NO MORE. OUR MINDS BREAK AND WE BECOME ONE WITH THE VOID. TAKING ON A FINAL GRAND TASK, WE WILLINGLY ENTER DESTRUCTION, FOR WE BELIEVE THAT, AT LEAST IN DESTRUCTION, WE MAY FINALLY KNOW TRUE REST.

<rift>BUT PITY US NOT, CALLOW ONE. YOUR WOOD-SCENTED CLAN CANNOT KNOW THE POWER IN OUR EXPLOSIVE BREATH, THE SECRETS OF OUR EVER-WAKING MINDS.

<rift>NO OTHER VESSEL COULD HAVE HELD THIS ESSENCE, AND THOUGH I SHALL EVENTUALLY STRANGLE MYSELF WITH MY OWN MIND, BEFORE I DO I SHALL ACCOMPLISH FEATS OF COURAGE AND POWER OF WHICH OTHER KIN COULD ONLY DREAM, SAVE THOSE WHO SURVIVE TO ELDER AGE.

<rift>I HAVE BEHELD THE NAKED VOID, AND IT GRANTS ME ALL OF ITS TRUTHS. THERE IS NO EXISTENCE LIKE UNTO THIS.

<rift>AND THERE ARE NONE BUT WE WHO TRULY KNOW HOW FRAGILE AND FLEETING IS THIS ANOMALY CALLED LIFE, AND HOW PRECIOUS.

<rift>THE TRAGEDY IS SUBLIME, AS IS THE RESPECT FOR ALL OF DOOMED CREATION WHICH IT ENGENDERS.

<rift>SUCH IS THE WAY OF THE ONYX CLAN. REJOICE, THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW EVEN THE SKIN OF IT. SHARE IT WITH NO OTHERS.

<rift>I WOULD NOT WISH KNOWLEDGE OF OUR SACRED TORMENT EVEN UPON MY ENEMIES. KEEP IT SECRET, AND BE GLAD THAT YOU KNOW IT NOT, BUT ONLY <italic>OF</italic> IT.

Finding your way back to Vantage's underground Lair is not difficult, but there seem to have been some... changes since you were last here.

Disquieted by your earlier success, the Ruby Kin has flooded this antechamber with Earth's deadly Essence. It has many names - fireflow, glowrun, redmelt - and it is almost universally feared.

Only members of the Ruby Clan, whose inner Fire burns hotter even than that of the Onyx, can endure such heat.

It seems that Vantage is still using traps to shield itself from outsiders, and this one is particularly simple and deadly. There does not seem to be any way around.

With a careful preening of your Fire-retardant saliva, you might be able to survive a quick passage through, but this is by no means certain. Entering in low health would be suicide, and even in perfect condition, the danger is great.

This is the final chamber before Vantage's personal sanctum. Which burns hotter: Earth's red Essence, or your desire for Vantage?

You finally collapse on the stone just beyond the chamber.

You have survived, somehow. The stone beneath you feels colder than ice after your deadly passage, though it is actually very hot.

You roll around frantically to douse any remnant flames and then lay there panting for some time. At last, you draw your partially-blackened Body upwards into a standing position. The sanctum awaits.

<tempest>OR HAVE YOU ALSO HUNTED THEIR MINDS, THEIR ESSENCE?

<tempest>I WOULD DANCE ONLY WITH ONE WHO IS OPEN TO THEIR TRUTHS.

<tempest>SING NOW TO ME.

<tempest>THEN WE ARE NOT YET TRUE EQUALS.

<tempest>PERHAPS IN ANOTHER HUNDRED TURNINGS YOU SHALL BE READY.

Tempest fades into the dark depths, refusing to be found again. It seems you will have to look elsewhere for a partner in the Dance of Creation.

As you find your way back to your Lair, however, you feel as though you have learned something of the Ways of lesser Goodbeasts through the challenge.

<tempest>YOU HAVE NOT CAST YOUR EYES MERELY UPWARD, BUT ALSO DOWNWARD.

<tempest>THERE IS AS MUCH TO BE LEARNED BY THOSE BELOW AS FROM THOSE ABOVE. THIS IS ALWAYS TRUE, BUT ESPECIALLY FOR OUR PEOPLE, WHO SUFFER FEW TO RISE OVER US.

<tempest>YOU HAVE NOT TURNED AWAY FROM OUR LESSER RELATIONS, BUT HAVE LEARNED THEIR WAYS.

<tempest>WITH SUCH TRUTHS ETCHED UPON YOUR ESSENCE, YOU SHALL NOT SUCCUMB TO PRIDE. YOU SHALL NOT BE YOUR OWN DOWNFALL...

<tempest>AND PERHAPS YOUR OFFSPRING SHALL BE THE SAME.

<tempest>THE SPARK OF DESIRE IS NOW A RAGING FLAME WITHIN ME. I FIND YOU WORTHY, AND WISH TO BECOME ONE WITH YOU.

<tempest>BUT OUR DANCE SHALL NOT BE PERFECT UNLESS THERE ARE TWO LUSTS, TWO FIRES.

<tempest>I SHALL NOT SING OF MYSELF. YOU HAVE BEHELD MY EMPIRE, MY WAYS.

<tempest>DO YOU DESIRE ME, AS I DESIRE YOU? AM I WORTHY OF YOU, AS YOU ARE OF ME?

<tempest>TORMENT ME NOT. IT IS TAKING ALL OF MY WILL TO HOLD MYSELF BACK FROM YOU.

==============================
Event: tc006_3a

You can barely see Tempest in this dark place...

But you do not need to see, only to feel, and Tempest is both powerful and tender in its movements. Suspended in the black, clean Waters, you Dance, and Dance again and again.

<tempest>THEN WHY DID YOU COME? DO YOU WISH TO TORMENT ME?

<tempest>NO MATTER. YOU ARE FREE, AND I RESPECT YOUR FREEDOM.

<tempest>GO THEN. AT LEAST I SHALL KNOW...

<tempest>THERE IS ANOTHER AMONG THE DRAAK WHO STILL CARES FOR THOSE WHO ARE LESS...

<tempest>THERE IS ONE WHO REMEMBERS THE SONGS OF OF OUR RELATIONS.

<tempest>FOR WE ARE ONE WITH ALL GOODBEASTS, NOW AND FOREVER.

Tempest fades into the dark depths, refusing to be found again. It seems you will have to look elsewhere for a partner in the Dance of Creation.

Is it odd that a Kin who pays so much mind to the Ways of lesser beings has become so strong?

Or is it only what is to be expected?

==============================
Event: tc007

The Time of Creation comes to an end.

The heat in your Core burns low and flickers out. The terrible pangs of Desire cease tormenting you.

You were not tortured in vain, however. You succeeded in performing the sacred Dance of Creation which summons Life in your very first Season.

Whether you are Birther or Giver... whether you carried them inside yourself or simply seeded them... there are now new Beings called into existence by you and another, new spirits pulled from the Void and given Reality.

Encased in fleshstone, they wait, patiently or impatiently, to meet Earth and Sun, having been buried in various places near the edge of their Birther-parent's territory.

Perhaps you visited them and Sang to them of the Great Laws, preparing them for Being. Perhaps you left that to their other parent.

In either case, you have Created more of the blessed and perfect beings known as the Draak-Kin, and extended an echo of yourself into the Future. The satisfaction runs deep.
