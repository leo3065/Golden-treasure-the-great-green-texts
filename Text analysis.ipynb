      "the tailless have grown strong in the low lands coldward along the great blue.\n",

      "so the mountain traded a little of its great size for legs and wandered the body of earth, eating green things and slowly chasing after its love.\n",
      "we give thanks for these bodies, which can now taste the sweetness of grass, can see horizon drape its colors over new places: the low green valleys, the sea.\n",
      "there is more delicious green here than we could ever consume.\n",
      "by the time you near the great blue, you have calmed down enough to sing, and you open your jaws and roar with beauty: behold me, mother earth!\n",
      "obviously pleased, they offer a gargantuan fire-red gem, finely cut and polished, in exchange.\n",
      "but if this is so, why do they murder the trees and chip away at the green, sub-mother of so many tribes?\n",
      "sleep sets in to your flesh, and your mind dances with excitement, hope and fear as you imagine what the spirit of the green will reveal, will give to its favored fang... truths unknown even to the elders?\n",
      "only when you have achieved a high degree of mastery in all four of the elements will your essence be sweet enough to attract such a mighty being as the green spirit.\n",
      "the ruby tribe, with their long, slender bodies and sensitive tongues, are best suited to travel along these blind hardpaths.\n",
      "you have an unknown but glorious destiny to fulfill, and the spirit of the green is with you, even here.\n",
      "about its neck is an object made of that precious shinestone known as gold, which glows like sun and never rusts or fades.\n",
      "it reeks of fear and a little of its own red essence.\n",
      "the gold gleams wetly.\n",
      "a strange blue fire, of an invisible kind.\n",
      "the emerald flame...\n",
      "the breath of the ruby kin is hot-beyond-fire.\n",
      "as you look on from just inside the cover of the great green, they begin casting things at each other, stones and fanged sticks from items of grazer-skin and dead tree, trying to harm their enemies without directly risking their own bodies.\n",
      "few trees grow here, but their smaller cousins form a lush patchwork of gold and purple threaded with green ravines and rocky gorges.\n",
      "your portion of the great green is bursting with health and life.\n",
      "a visit to the spirit of the green is in order; you should present yourself in your final form and commune with it.\n",
      "even more shockingly, they then proceed to put more things into the hole: glittering stones, pieces of amber cunningly strung together, a figurine of what looks like a lumberer out of bone, even one of the shinestone false-fangs which they use as weapons.\n",
      "whence this grey-blue burden which seemed to be afflicting all of them?\n",
      "with great intention, the elder plunges the shard into the surefoot's body again and again, until the shard and its paws are slick and red.\n",
      "a pleasure-flight brings you over a forested hill, one among infinite peers in the great green.\n",
      "as you fly over it, taking the greys, greens and blues into your eyes, a delicious aroma rises up of fertility and decay.\n",
      "surrender to me its coldward horizon, all that lies within sight or scent of the spiritwood, for i name it unto myself; the warmcool waters, the savory flesh of those who dwell neither in the green nor the blue but both, and neither.\n",
      "satisfied that you have done your duty as guardian of the green, you turn to other matters.\n",
      "the green is safe once again, and you may turn to other matters.\n",
      "it pains you to sense the tree-deaths, which afterwards you often do, and your territory is shrinking bit by bit as the no-tails chew away at the great green, but you decide to tolerate it, for now.\n",
      "i am the sovereign of the great green.\n",
      "the green is alive with the usual sounds; the singing of tiny beings, leaves brushing against each other gently in the breeze.\n",
      "from the scent, it is an emerald kin, and hiding just inside this rather undignified hole.\n",
      "after this, it leaves the great green and never returns.\n",
      "as their birthers fly off to various places in the great green to birth their eggs and then die, one of their givers alights on your tail.\n",
      "the sunfly uses its last moments in a heroic effort to fly upwards, to see sun above the trees one last time, to taste the fleeting feeling of being alive one last, precious time, but it does not succeed, leaving its fragile, tiny shell as one among many in the great green.\n",
      "you sing of the far corners of the great green, and beyond, of lands the sunfly has never and could never have seen.\n",
      "by sun-rise, the great green is abuzz with the news of how you survived an especially vicious attack from a deadly foe and feasted on its remains.\n",
      "you carry it out of the green and into the tailless-infested lands.\n",
      "by sun-rise, the great green is abuzz with the news of how you survived an especially vicious attack from a deadly foe whose corpse is already being devoured by scavengers.\n",
      "the great green is never wasteful.\n",
      "the flatfaces have fled, and their leader wheezes its last red-misted breath as you roar out in triumph.\n",
      "through your song of victory, all the green will know that the tailless brought their heroes against you, and you destroyed them.\n",
      "it pains you to sense it, which afterwards you often do, and your territory is shrinking bit by bit as the no-tails chew away at the great green.\n",
      "for now, though, you may feel proud in having fulfilled your duty as the living fang of the green.\n",
      "the flatfaces have been defeated, and their leader wheezes its last red-misted breath as you roar out in triumph.\n",
      "one sun, you hear the crashing death-scream of one of the forest guardians, a mighty tree which has stood for turnings beyond counting near the boundary of the great green.\n",
      "you soon learn that the incident is not isolated; regularly, the no-tails come to the boundary of the great green and murder the trees, taking the bodies away to their hive and an unknown fate.\n",
      "the tailless must be annihilated, or the great green, which you love and in whose bosom you rest, shall be no more.\n",
      "i stand for the green and the blue against the choking grey.\n",
      "some say that its body was burned to charcoal in the core of the world, its bones bursting and red-cracked, but that its mind was so strong that it knit itself back together again, though the pain of the exploding moment never receded.\n",
      "for now, you must continue your existence in the great green, under the shadow of those who have endured the eons.\n",
      "the great blue shall drown in waste, a black rainbow outrage poured upon its surface, barren silt swallowing the last memories below.\n",
      "we shall become fantasies for the no-tails to prove their power to themselves... and the immortal spirit of the green, which should rightfully outlast us, shall die.\n",
      "the green has taught you well.\n",
      "philosophical hate-red. hate-red.\n",
      "what is more, it seems to be made out of \"gold\", one of the ultimate forms of shinestone, a fitting tribute to the greatness of the kin.\n",
      "in fact, this place smells as though it never knew the great green at all... or even earth herself.\n",
      "of all the goodbeasts of the great green, the woodstriders have the purest essence.\n",
      "and you, longear, depart in peace, and partake of the endless green feast without fear.\n",
      "to fight against this truth is fruitless, and to escape it is to abandon earth and sun and this blue-green world we love.\n",
      "\"if i am destroyed, my many relations under the good green hill will first worry, and then fear, and then despair!\n",
      "i will begin with simplicity: up above, i am green, on the ground, i am rusty.\n",
      "it swoops wide around the crater before turning setwards towards its lair deep within the great blue.\n",
      "there is a very good reason that the blazetails thrive all across the great green and beyond, even near the cursed hives of the no-tails; wise, swift and without shame, they are masters at cheating destruction.\n",
      "you have barely begun to dig when the face of a ruby kin appears at the top of the pit.\n",
      "this serves as both a display of benign disinterest in fighting and a warning - those teeth look rather sharp, and the breath of the ruby kin, a clan to which vantage obviously belongs, is known to be the fiercest and most deadly of all the draak.\n",
      "once you reach the edge of the great green, vantage breaks off its pursuit and returns to its high heathlands.\n",
      "after finally climbing out of the pit, you flatten yourself against the brown brush and, using your deep water knowledge, shift your armor to take on its color.\n",
      "the ruby draak is gone by the time you climb up out of the trap.\n",
      "the ruby kin is gone by the time you climb up out of the trap.\n",
      "you begin to tell a deep blue story to vantage, a tale of water and night.\n",
      "you weave slithering images of slow green beings through the reeds of your opponent's mind.\n",
      "wary of this, vantage resists, filling your mind with orange distractions.\n",
      "to claim the land near the very spirit of the great green is either foolishly dangerous or dangerously foolish.\n",
      "your claim went unchallenged because few would dare to lay their treasure down so near to the green one.\n",
      "the spiritwood, heart of the great green, shall try, temper, teach, test.\n",
      "(20 shiny things) great one, have you any advice for a young kin of the great green?\n",
      "many fires have been extinguished before their birth by the woodstriders, who tend the green, and others have flared to ruinous life for lack of them.\n",
      "with a tender and delicate destruction, they root out the too-manys and too-muches, green-beyond-green.\n",
      "in their humble, quiet way, they are the ultimate protectors, moving from green to green and patiently, carefully tending with tooth and tongue.\n",
      "through eons of service, they have become beloved of the spirit of the great green.\n",
      "you remember the pure and delicious scent of the woodstriders of heartbone valley... but very, very rarely have you sensed it in the deep spiritwood, heart of the great green, where you now live.\n",
      "if they are not many in the great green, then the line they follow must be marred, stained.\n",
      "seek out the stain and wash it away, for you are the fang of the great green, guardian of the sacred land.\n",
      "act so that your lands will be green and home to many goodbeasts for you to feast upon, to learn from, for thousands of turnings.\n",
      "only when you recognize them as the bearers of the true crown will they take their place within the green.\n",
      "they also frequent the deep parts of the great green, and gather many things, tasting of them, though they never destroy, nor have any hatchlings of their kind been found.\n",
      "the spirit of the great green has given them crowns, some visible and some invisible, which branch from their minds in curves and points like beautiful trees.\n",
      "they are powerful indeed, and the green owes its existence to them, subtly, gently.\n",
      "and of course, the great green would be poorer without the beautiful songs they sing, the greatest of which can only be sung by many at once.\n",
      "it dwells in the crimson deeps, where glowing earth flows like slow water.\n",
      "third is the living-drowned, the blue-cored, the cool darkness, the deep one, fathom.\n",
      "in the setward great blue, it quietly reigns far below the grey waves.\n",
      "in a far riseward realm, all kin lower themselves in the presence of jade cloud, and the fiery islands beyond fear the raging glory of bladetail-of-the-several-minds.\n",
      "the spiritwood, heart of the great green, may now belong to a certain young kin in name, but not yet does it truly belong to it.\n",
      "one is also not alone in being near to the heart of the green.\n",
      "for you have come near to the old tree, lair of the spirit of the great green, in whose honor they call your part of the great green the spiritwood.\n",
      "it sings to you, writing sigils which burn with painful joy in your mind: beloved hatchling... scion of the draak-kin... fang of the great green.\n",
      "see all as one, and let your power bring balance to the great green.\n",
      "such is the way of the great green, and it is good.\n",
      "soon afterward, a kin appears, one of the sapphire clan, who have power wherever water rules.\n",
      "ask about the sapphire clan.\n",
      "you know not to return until you have matured, but then you may face the sapphire kin again, and perhaps be victorious.\n",
      "while your emerald clan became enamored of the great green, my clan made a pact with the great blue.\n",
      "the spirit of the great green lives close by.\n",
      "let me bring you a swift and clean end, so that the wrongness shall die here and your childrens' children will live in peace in a great green free of its evil.\n",
      "truly, this was a worthy child of the green, and though others may never know of it, many were spared by its sacrifice.\n",
      "it is one of your own emerald clan, and a rather stunning specimen.\n",
      "you wonder if the spirit of the great green truly wants such a thing as \"perfection.\"\n",
      "if it pleases the spirit of the great green to have you as seneschal of its inner lands, i will offer no debate.\n",
      "first, i was a blazing vein of earth, red blood of the great birther given mind.\n",
      "your loss will be felt by the great green.\n",
      "a mote of deep red light dances in front of you as it is taken upon the wind.\n",
      "and having bound the beginning to the end, the great green itself stands silent, in awe before the beauty of your song, a true song of farewell which you may never accomplish again.\n",
      "there is an azure flame, a hidden harmony between fire and water.\n",
      "there are many such in the great green.\n",
      "they request, with polite lemon colors in their song, that you now honor your side of the agreement.\n",
      "when you at last manage to locate it, writhing question is understandably hesitant to let you remove the tuft of its perfect, perfect tail, but agrees (in question form, of course) to give you what you seek if you can bring it a fine longear to feast upon, and then defeat it in a fair riddle challenge while avoiding thinking of the color yellow and keeping your tail held to the left.\n",
      "keeping yourself from thinking about the color yellow is far, far more difficult than it sounds, but you manage it long enough to arrive at the riddle which will decide the contest: if you have me, you want to share me; if you share me, you haven't got me.\n",
      "the green here is... merged.\n",
      "we are a living question, writhing through the green on a holy mission, are we not?\n",
      "they cover us like fur, like the long wheat-grasses which blanket earth's tender parts, and do any of them have, or deserve, answers?\n",
      "you were under the impression that this was part of your own territory, the spiritwood, heart of the great green.\n",
      "does this draak-kin believe itself to be the greatest power in the green?\n",
      "why would a young kin assume that there is only one \"heart\" of the great green, when in fact every being within it flows with the rhythm of life, and its hearts are many?\n",
      "but perhaps we should be more indulgent; how could it know the grand design of the allmother, to whom all beings are beloved, and how could it know that the allmother has linked the essence of all beings in this most blessed of greens together as one?\n",
      "you declare that their \"treasure\" does not interest you, and ignore their bright yellow song of protest as you rip their life-hive out of its arboreal rest.\n",
      "many are the tiny beings of the great green.\n",
      "this sun, however, you come upon the golden village of a particularly well-ordered species of tiny beings, their bodies streaked in sun-yellow and night-black; you decide to call them honeybuzz, for the sound their wings make and the strange, syrupy substance with which they fill their hexagonal homes.\n",
      "while most such beings have small minds like single sparks of yellow or green (or red when angered), and by and large these are no exception, the settlement is home to a more advanced being, one who carries the essence of all of the hive within itself: a honeybuzz arch-birther.\n",
      "following the shallow river which runs through the spiritwood to the great blue, you come upon a clearly (and frequently) marked scent-boundary.\n",
      "one of the kin claims this green and pleasant land as its territory, known as the riverwood for its harmonious combination of plants and fresh, clean water.\n",
      "it takes quite a bit of time before you fully grasp what they are asking for: they need the green-orange kind of shinestone called \"copper\".\n",
      "its pure state means that they will not need to spend time extracting and refining the \"copper\" they seek, saving precious energy.\n",
      "with silent acceptance, you leave the creature and step over the soft soil, back into the green.\n",
      "this is the lair of the spirit of the great green.\n",
      "if you truly know the great green... if you truly understand its spirit... then bring to me one of its fangs.\n",
      "the fang of the spirit of the great green?\n",
      "you inform the liminal that you have already brought it one of the fangs of the spirit of the great green, for behold: as the trees are its feathers and the grass its fur, the streams and rivers are its essence and the stones are its bones, the draak-kin have been from ancient days the very fangs of the great green.\n",
      "the liminal bows its head and lowers its eyes, acknowledging your victory, and you move through it to the heart, the very core of the great green.\n",
      "fathom's head bobs twice, and you are briefly terrified that it will breathe the notorious secret thunder of the sapphire draak upon you, but instead it coughs up a shimmering sphere.\n",
      "this is a \"pearl\", born of the discomfort of the voiceless, shaped over many turnings by secret dwellers of the great blue.\n",
      "still, the tusksnorts are largely an honorable and honest tribe of goodbeasts, and their eldest allows it: this festival is in the spirit of summer, and the feast which is the great green is shared by many, the old birther sings.\n",
      "may the scents of my clan not cross your path in your hunger, and may the green one watch you with gentle eye, it snorts before leading its clan away in high spirits.\n",
      "one herb in particular seems to bloom into flowers of a slightly darker shade of blue than usual when its roots are very close to a truffle.\n",
      "see, the green feast is laid out before you; bear with you the twin tusks of courage and clan and life becomes a banquet, an unending meal for the soul!\n",
      "their scent-marks tell a similar tale, and soon all of the green is telling the story of the draak whose senses nothing could escape.\n",
      "it's just on the edge of perception, but there is a \"color\" to the truffles' scent, grey-blue like rain and yet with the dark tinge of the void and silvery flecks of salt.\n",
      "see, the green feast is laid out before you; bear with you the twin tusks of courage and clan and life becomes a feast, an unending meal for the soul!\n",
      "on this new sun, the great green takes you to an ancient tree, large in stature and rife with featherbeast and furbeast.\n",
      "as you approach, a treetail sings to you for aid with a frantic song: they mar, they break, they maim, scarring the skin of our sacred home, feasting upon the tiny children of the green, the featherbeasts, the barkborers, the defilers!\n",
      "your store of green knowledge about airlings has grown.\n",
      "it continues to bite the air and scratch the trees as you return to the deeper green.\n",
      "they do not disclose all of the details to you, but the deep mauve sincerity and indigo humility which mark all of their thoughts are proof that they are truthful, and that you, and the great green, have nothing to fear from them.\n",
      "you have no idea where in the great green you are.\n",
      "setward from your lair, you can barely make out the great tree where rests the spirit of the great green.\n",
      "there is no trace of the no-tails here, nor has there ever been; their kind has never marred the heart of the great green, the wild forest primeval.\n",
      "when you awaken, you know in your core that the soul of this land, the spiritwood, heart of the great green, has accepted your presence here.\n",
      "a sapphire kin, full of fury, appears, having been warned of your presence by the flight of featherbeasts and the unusual movement of various waterlings.\n",
      "such is the way of the green.\n",
      "you can see them, see them all, burying their terrible soft talons and blunt teeth into the great birther sucking the essence out of her, leaving earth stained with a rainbow-black death and horribly, horribly, horribly dry why what are they you must destroy them you must save the green\n",
      "next, you turn to the spring, and you feel a faint, ruby-tinged presence lying below the stones.\n",
      "you have, at last, reached the old one, tree-vessel of the spirit of the great green.\n",
      "it was the very first of its kind, the beginning of the green, and like the spirit, it has died and been reborn within itself many times.\n",
      "as reality settles from the fall and you emerge from the green, you see before you a crater in the earth, a hole many body-lengths wide.\n",
      "it stands proud and tall, looking down on you and your treasure-to-be with eyes of black and gold.\n",
      "slowly, it reaches out with a warm and soft song: o little child-kin, know me: i am fathom, mate of the great blue and knower of its inner ways from turnings beyond thought.\n",
      "i have known the lower void, furthest depths of the blue, and now i must know the upper void, the above everlasting.\n",
      "in the end, you catch nothing at all that day, and your core berates you with low growls as you watch the helpless hatchling leave the great green and into the tainted lands close to the hive of its people.\n",
      "in the mind-song of the goodbeasts of the great green, that is the name given to this place.\n",
      "while exploring the great green one day, you taste strangeness on the wind; salt, fear, and something unnervingly other.\n",
      "following the scent, you soon discover a lone no-tail hatchling, stumbling through the green on its insufficient legs.\n",
      "guard it, and lead it to the edge of the green.\n",
      "today's travel through the green brings you to a scene of suspended chaos.\n",
      "it smells like dreams, with strands of green fiber-flesh and murmurs of heartbreak and the beyond.\n",
      "the sentry is shocked by your sudden attack, and its red essence is already upon your claws and fangs before it can properly react.\n",
      "dazed and wounded, it flees into the green.\n",
      "silently, you withdraw from the lair of the clansingers and hasten into the green, leaving before the clan arrives.\n",
      "for turnings beyond memory, our great and proud people hunted and roamed in the land beyond the great blue.\n",
      "you retreat from that place, and make your way to the heart of the green, where the spirit dwells.\n",
      "you have searched for several things which may help, have meditated in the deep green and danced under the stars to prepare yourself for this ordeal.\n",
      "your body is almost destroyed, leaking red essence from many places, and the final curse has become a dis-ease inside of you, but the rhythm of life is still yours.\n",
      "but what to do with a lone no-tail on the edge of the great green...?\n",
      "perhaps the no-tail will survive and rejoin its kind, or perhaps it will be destroyed by the great green.\n",
      "sun is dying, painting the green gold, and you sing a last benediction for the fallen bladefangs: they were warriors.\n",
      "you call out with your mind to the holy fire within your essence, and then you see it, floating within you like shining strands of dawn-red.\n",
      "you begin to gather them together, strand after strand of crimson, and like a webcrafting weaver you spin it into a fabric, spilling out of your mouth.\n",
      "all of the spirit-strands are burned in the fire, turning red and escaping upwards and into the sky, reaching toward sun... and then they are gone.\n",
      "flow red and warm!\n",
      "we forced this body to seek out the spiritwood, the heart of the great green, where the hard laws are weak, and hidden things are strong.\n",
      "even the great blue we have defeated, crossing over it by coldward ice-paths.\n",
      "it sings of the mighty voice of its people, how their songs have echoed from the mountains and run down the rivers to the great blue, where those who dwell below marvel at their truth.\n",
      "it sings of the sacred pilgrimage taken by the clan to the heart of the great green, where they obtained the gnosis of their true being: that they are the claws of the spirit, talons of the green one.\n",
      "you recount your trials in heartbone valley, your struggle to survive, how you won the stewardship of the great green, and how even old and wise draak honor your claim.\n",
      "you sing eloquently of the many things which your vast mind can encompass which no individual clansinger could: such glories as number, and the secrets of shinestone and earth's many other silent children, and green knowledge of beings great and small.\n",
      "closing your senses, you reach out with your essence, expanding your mind until you can hold all of the great green within it.\n",
      "we know you hold red destruction in your mouth lightly, like an adult holds a cub in its jaws.\n",
      "you swear a mighty oath to the spirit of the great green that you shall never again enter their territory or hunt on their lands.\n",
      "its violet eyes meet yours, but too late, you are sure... it cannot move quickly enough to evade you.\n",
      "as they broaden their search for whatever-it-is, one notices you, and then all three are suddenly looking at you with piercing, violet eyes.\n",
      "one even uses its small pink tongue to taste your crownfeathers (which is, of course, what you would do to a particularly interesting object also).\n",
      "it is almost as if yellow poppyseed hemlock... the next thing you know, sun has fallen, moon has risen, and the brightlings are gone, leaving not even a scent-trail behind.\n",
      "as you approach, one notices you, and then all three are suddenly looking at you with piercing, violet eyes.\n",
      "one even uses its small pink tongue to taste your crownfeathers.\n",
      "they back away and stand still for several moments, and then return to their prior investigation of the green, ignoring you.\n",
      "several chunks of the violet gemstone have been left near the mouth of the cave, which you transport back to your lair.\n",
      "it is the will of the green!\n",
      "when the hunting-moon rises over the great green, a new song may be heard.\n",
      "you see it as only one essence, but you know that they are many in body: the woodstriders, the crowned, the beloved-of-the-green.\n",
      "the clan joins in song: behold: we are the claws of the great green, and you are not respected by our clan.\n",
      "the stain has been removed, but still you dream of fire feasting on the green, of hunting-grounds burned away and a land left desolate.\n",
      "it gently holds the future of the great green in its mouth.\n",
      "command it to fight for the green.\n",
      "great greens for eons have been tended by their people, even by the spirits of their people before they took on these bodies, and never have they asked for any reward.\n",
      "instead, they have only given more, and more... more flesh, more time, more frozen winters watching over the green.\n",
      "you feel the pain of breaking and frozen flesh, suffered for more turnings of earth than there are leaves in the great green, or drops of water in the great blue.\n",
      "you praise their strength and bravery, but remind them that you are the rightful ruler of the spiritwood, heart of the great green, and it is their place to obey you.\n",
      "it is not red essence which they take and give.\n",
      "with a single look, it imparts the truth; it, and not you, holds the true power to save the green.\n",
      "now, it is time for you to summon the gentle woodstriders, who give of their flesh and their safety and their lives so that the green may be truly great, by acknowledging what they are.\n",
      "some draak may sing about how you dared to suggest that the kin were not the ultimate form of life on this world, and your reputation may suffer... but you have had the wisdom to see why the great green itself has given the woodstriders the crown.\n",
      "they are the mate of the green itself, caring silently for it forever.\n",
      "our people are found all over the great mother's body, and our song echoes from every green.\n",
      "it is a hunting-moon, and as you bathe in the moonlight outside of your lair and look over your domain, a many-voiced song rises up from the depths of the great green.\n",
      "their birther-chief then comes to the fore: i am fragrant-spirit, whose essence is pleasing to the green one, creator of many and source of life.\n",
      "the woodstriders, beloved children of the green, flayed, tortured, disemboweled while still living.\n",
      "the wet amber glistens mockingly.\n",
      "the amber did not budge from its spot, and trying again is possible, but this is a rather exhausting way to build strength.\n",
      "it takes quite a bit of time, but you push and lift the stones one by one until they reveal the fugitive amber.\n",
      "their apricot sparkle looks even more fetching when they find their new home in your trove.\n",
      "as the suns pass, you will come to enjoy the apricot sparkle of these rare gems, but you are definitely beginning to see why the ruby kin prefer to steal their crystals from the delvers rather than wrestle it from the stone themselves.\n",
      "starving, you pick through the bones of the quiet in a green turned grey.\n",
      "your dreams that night are filled with the music of the great blue.\n",
      "you let out a fiery, triumphant roar which echoes through the green.\n",
      "it is \"amber\", made out of the essence of trees and refined by time.\n",
      "predictably, the bounty is less this time, but simply lounging on the shore, listening to the roaring rhythm of the great blue, makes the sun spent here feel more than worthwhile.\n",
      "there is no further need to spend time here, though you will, of course, stop by at various times to listen to the song of the great blue, eternally eloquent in its gentle, rhythmic roars.\n",
      "the walls are marbled with purple-red gem-crust.\n",
      "the great blue.\n",
      "however, all that is in the sea has been claimed by others; you smell the personal scent of a sapphire kin on the waves.\n",
      "there is a potent smell wafting from the cave, grey-green and odious.\n",
      "shriekers are bony and their wings do not taste good, but their bright red essence is quite sweet.\n",
      "soon you are covered with red-brown shriekers, all biting and scratching at your scales with their sharp claws.\n",
      "i hear popping, crackling screams from my green children, and the goodbeasts flee, or perish.\n",
      "i am the great green.\n",
      "the heart of the great green sings with the beautiful chaos of nature, and i am whole.\n",
      "soon, the green shall be transformed into a bastion for our prophet and liege and all who wisely worship this pure and perfect mystagogue!\n",
      "this will mean your permanent exile from the spiritwood, the loss of all of your treasure, and the end of your story in the great green, though any animal mastery or special achievements (cards) you have gained will remain.\n",
      "as your predator-warriors emerge from the green to stand by your side, bloom is visibly shaken.\n",
      "your clansingers begin a sonorous melody, praising earth and sun, recounting your many noble deeds, the powerful and honorable way you won their loyalty, and your acceptance by the spirit of the great green.\n",
      "you have crushed another invader, and the spiritwood, heart of the great green, remains yours, and yours alone.\n",
      "tiny flickers of blue dance in the blast.\n",
      "this will mean your exile from the spiritwood, the loss of all of your treasure, and the end of your story in the great green, though any animal mastery or special knowledge you have gained will remain.\n",
      "carefully, you begin to construct mental imagery which fortifies your claim to the great green, but flare's mind is so occupied with blasting forth its own challenge that you cannot find a way inside.\n",
      "in flare's mind, you create an image of yourself as the unassailable lord of the great green, with your feet steadfast like the roots of ancient trees.\n",
      "go forth in the knowledge that the great green shall have a worthy suzerain.\n",
      "long nights and cold breezes slowly steal away the deep greens of the spiritwood and leave fragile riots of yellow and orange, crusted with crystal frost in the morning.\n",
      "when last you laid yourself down for a great sleep, you were just a copper-skinned hatchling.\n",
      "before, you were merely infatuated with the heart of the great green, but now you have come to truly love it, to feel its fortunes as yours.\n",
      "the path to salvation is paved with scarlet streams and broken bones, but by our sacrifice, our great mother shall be healed.\n",
      "the baretail places a red gem of some kind on the ground before you and then quickly yet respectfully withdraws.\n",
      "it is like shards of shinestone are being forced into your core, where they then take on a life of their own and attempt to slowly slice their way out of your body in every direction, bursting scarlet from between every scale of your armor.\n",
      "you might think it all a dream if the red crystal, now dull and lifeless, did not lay before you still.\n",
      "slowly the shadows fade to reveal the form of a colorless ruby kin.\n",
      "using the water within, you take on the colors of the darkened green.\n",
      "my claws will whisper between your scales and into your essence-red core.\n",
      "you leap at it, and you see a pair of baleful, rose-colored eyes briefly before it retreats from your attack, blending into the darkness again.\n",
      "the yellow crystal remains on the ground.\n",
      "a small, sun-yellow crystal is laid at your feet, and writhing question vanishes into the undergrowth.\n",
      "you can only watch, unable to move or even breathe, as veins of sapphire light travel up your forepaw in bizarre right angles.\n",
      "having defeated the kin, guardians of earth, the victorious others created three flat-faced, tailless tribes to spread their dominion: the short, strong delvers to seize earth's bounty from within, the wily custodians to tame the great green and gather the treasures of the surface, and the massive enforcers, to administer a new law and keep the others weak and docile.\n",
      "in their chaos, the custodians rose up against the enforcers and destroyed them.\n",
      "they thrived and prospered, and at last one rose over them, elder of elders, first of the first, the queen and empress of all kin.\n",
      "pecunius blanches a lighter shade of scarlet.\n",
      "you do notice that more survive here than in the great blue by far.\n",
      "the passageway of roots and brown earth-flesh soon leads to a space defined by her bones.\n",
      "do not forget the great lesson which i have imparted to you in the form of the blue labyrinth.\n",
      "after coming to the great green from the great blue, i quickly found that their eyes were as sharp as their talons, and their minds sharper still.\n",
      "i have several caverns full of small shiny things, and other artifacts in storage at various locations, most of them in the great blue.\n",
      "the emerald flame, your birther-creator, was guardian of the spiritwood at the time of your creation.\n",
      "while passionate in its defense of the sacred land, the emerald flame was deeply traditional, and strong with the element of fire.\n",
      "it would be no exaggeration to say that the emerald flame relished the flavor of their flesh.\n",
      "now, you are the emerald flame's legacy.\n",
      "the last of the visions fade away, and the golden mind-song of the vast floating being flows into you: to expand the aspirant's mental perspective: all lessons, all truths, are like the great blue, possessing an apparent surface but also harboring vast and secret depths.\n",
      "then unwillingly they shed their scales, which fell like sand to the bottom of the great blue, and wasted away, and perished, floating upwards into the accursed air.\n",
      "one must eat nothing which contains the color yellow.\n",
      "the color yellow.\n",
      "chartreuse.\n",
      "puce.\n",
      "there are a number of delicious things which could be said to be \"yellow\" in some way, and they deprive themselves of such things simply because the law commands it, though no reasons are given.\n",
      "and this is surely the great blue, open to the stars, and not an underground pool.\n",
      "when our bodies are destroyed, we will surely live on in the great above, and look down upon others from the bright blue stars.\n",
      "you died... here are a bunch of the fonts for different characters darktooth herons salamanders never-ever spider fireflies ox magpie wolf water spirit valhalla badger cat queen blue fungus great green spirit rat thieves vantage tempest warden trapped ibex bats labyrinth entrance eagle owl writhing question those are all the ones in the current game.\n",
      "what is correct, from the number of water-drops in the great blue to the best response to any question, is fluid and ever-changing.\n",
      "i met the spirit of the great green, and became shaman-lord of the spiritwood.\n",
      "i am of the emerald clan.\n",
      "i am the keeper of the heart of the great green.\n",
      "our story will end, and there will be nothing left to discover in the great green, for how can there be discovery when one has no separation from all things?\n",
      "are you not of the emerald clan?\n",
      "i will bury you in gold, so much that all shall desire you, all shall look upon your wealth and despair.\n",
      "in time, the old spirit of that land passed into the beyond, and a new spirit, free from judgment and fear and desire, rose over the great green.\n",
      "every being born in the green was an echo of that great spirit's music, and it welcomed each one back into itself upon destruction, seasoned by having been.\n",
      "they would see the shadow of the spirit of the green, and through it, a vision of a reality beyond themselves.\n",
      "it shall leave this world, and pass away from all knowledge of the green and the blue.\n",
      "i choose the first way, the way of survival, the green path.\n",
      "you were chosen by the spirit of the great green to inherit its core.\n",
      "i will remain spirit-keeper, and protect the great green.\n",
      "the keeper of the heart of the great green has chosen wisely.\n",
      "the spirit of the great green shall be enthroned in trees and hear the voices of countless free goodbeasts who shall praise it forever... and you, the faithful guardian, who did not abandon this world, but stood glorious, naked and unafraid against the abominations and their false coverings.\n",
      "and yet, unto the uttermost end of the crimson path, i bless you, my beloved.\n",
      "if you have come to love the great green and its inhabitants, of course you would wish to protect them, my beloved child.\n",
      "together, we shall save the great green and its spirit.\n",
      "in its awakened state, it projects rotating spheres and spirals, painting them in emerald light on the cold air.\n",
      "slowly, the green will creep back into this place and fill it with itself.\n",
      "it will be healthy, and one with the green.\n",
      "keeper of the heart of the great green.\n",
      "great green warrior.\n",
      "…….. warrior of the good and green way.\n",
      "gone shall be the great green and the great blue both.\n",
      "are not our very essences bound to the green, the blue, the above and the below of this world?\n",
      "beyond the grey-to-come, the great green and the great blue can rise again.\n",
      "we... shall guide them from the grey to the blue and the green.\n",
      "let the blue be forever blue, the green forever green.\n",
      "we shall walk in crimson beauty along this path, or we shall perish.\n",
      "you are young, but you have lived closest to the spirit of the great green.\n",
      "each action, each discovery, each sun has been a lesson to you from the spirit of the great green.\n",
      "recall the beauty of the green, the wild, free goodbeasts which have served you, nourished you, and know that only by choosing my path can they be saved.\n",
      "join with me, and become the salvation of the great green.\n",
      "you follow the gathering flight of kin coldwards and setwards to a large island emerging from the great blue.\n",
      "there also is fathom, keeper of the depths, who makes its home lower even than the great below, mightiest of the sapphire clan.\n",
      "even jade cloud, the soft-sung yet undisputed master of the riseward lands, has come.\n",
      "this small infestation, which stands within your territory, has been declared an affront to all that is good and green.\n",
      "the draak-kin shall rule over a green and healthy earth forever.\n",
      "this story, the story of your childhood in the great green, is over.\n",
      "as sun and earth roll on, you find a place of wealth and fulfillment in the blessed great green... and its spirit smiles upon you, and upon a land clean of pollution and corruption.\n",
      "at first, you did not know that there was a voice, only a strange sensation unfolding in your mind: a soothing warmth, pulses of orange color and the comforting taste of brimstone on your tongue.\n",
      "the voice responds by singing a vision and feeling of cool, damp earth, pregnant with green life, into you.\n",
      "the voice accepts your choice with an explosion of red and golden sparks and a happy rage.\n",
      "it calls to us, as the sky and the sea and the great green call to all things a song of invitation.  \n",
      "the voice's song suddenly turns darkly crimson.\n",
      "you can tell from the cerulean tinge in its song that the voice is pleased with such an ambitious question, but the song which comes back is circuitous and uncertain.\n",
      "if the most precious treasures which rest deep within earth were turned to flesh, that flesh might be compared with the velvety, tender meat of a darksweet, laced with ruby essence which smacks of rising moons and summer evenings freshly remembered.\n",
      "drinking the vermilion essence from its wounds is done easily enough, but cracking open its stone-skin to get at the rest of its body is much more difficult.\n",
      "most waterbound are tasty, but this one is especially so; its pink flesh tears apart tenderly, with barely a sound, and its rare oils settle nicely into your core.\n",
      "having removed such a creature from the great green fills you with pride and regret in equal measure.\n",
      "...you have, however, stopped glowing blue.\n",
      "the flesh of this handsome lord of the great green is fittingly delicious.\n",
      "power and energy fill your core, flooding into your essence, as you consume the body of this, the largest furbeast of the great green.\n",
      "the deep red, moist flesh of this belligerent featherbeast was worth the trouble.\n",
      "but you have sensed enough... you hunger for its tender flesh and thirst for its crimson essence.\n",
      "spend a sun researching the amber circle.\n",
      "spend a sun researching the gold choker.\n",
      "life comes creeping gently, uncertainly in, and you watch it impassively as it spreads green grow-children and red-essenced agents near you and upon you, though few dare to tread your heights, where the air is so pure that even life fears its beautiful desolation.\n",
      "you literally explode into existence, and your first experience is a noble hunger; chomping, grasping with your yellow tongue, your orange teeth, you gobble the air around you.\n",
      "the great green, the world-spine mountains, all of it you cover with your blazing wings.\n",
      "only the great blue defies you, but already you have moved beyond: rising ever more powerful, you seize sun, great sun, in your sparking talons and sink your fangs into him.\n",
      "a clean azure flavor slides across your tongue... water, the comforter and supporter of all life, is here, gathered into a still body before you.\n",
      "if it would build a land of its own, its destiny lies coldward, in the great green.\n",
      "the emerald flame's seed sprouts what may grow into a mighty tree.\n",
      "here, you can recall the many denizens of the great green you will meet.\n",
      "you emerge in time to see your first sun ending, and as he dies in scarlet glory, new, smaller illuminations are born in the opposite corner of the sky.\n",
      "some are red as the body of fire, some green as the grasses of earth, some blue as the deeps of water, some white as the clouds of the air.\n",
      "as leaves upon one branch, as branches upon one tree, as trees within one green, as green within the land, as land within earth, as earth within the onesong, so are all things:  many and one,  one and many,  all connected at the center.\n",
      "i sing of the crimson water, where flows the rhythm of life within, its waves and tides shaping my sacred body and those of all of my relations, fueling the senses and bringing healing and emotion.\n",
      "may i create wonders in my wake, springing up like trees and green things; may my gentle passage shatter stone and carve valleys.\n",
      "i sing of the fire below, deep within the bosom of the great mother, from which flows her hot, red essence.\n",
      "you have barely opened your maw to roar out your challenge before the massive kin strikes, quick as a thought, slicing and scoring your tender armor with two quick strikes which spill droplets of your crimson essence out onto the grey rocks.\n",
      "you see your creator lying silent before the no-tails, their chattering, screeching voices barking something incomprehensible as the red kin-essence spreads along the ground.\n",
      "your exploration of the warmward meadow and the strange scent takes you into a vast region of rising hills, lightly furred with brown heather and scaled with grey boulders.\n",
      "it is vast and beautiful, like a great nation unto itself, but blue, with accents like the storm-grey rocks of the hills; its scales bear the hundred thousand marks of the lovely brutality of kin life, and yet its essence shines healthy and bright from its melted-gold eyes, the midnight slit of its pupil eyeing you surprisingly calmly.\n",
      "this one has flown the skies since before your creators were hatched, has learned secret songs from within the belching firemountains and the depths of the great blue, where the blue becomes black.\n",
      "red indicates that you cannot succeed (at least, not without problems) in your current state, while green indicates your feeling that you certainly can.\n",
      "yellow means that it is too close to be sure.\n",
      "the noble red essence of a great kin, shed not in a true dance of destruction, but trapped, tortured.\n",
      "your body is singing a crimson hymn, lancing through your veins as your dark scarlet essence seeps out, falling away.\n",
      "you express your deep admiration of its beauty, noting the subtle blue shimmers within its dark feathers and the pearl-like shine of its lighter parts.\n",
      "a few dozen suns, if darktooth is correct, and then you must leave this temporary den for the emerald reaches of the great green, that vast, unclaimed empire of trees which lies coldward from here.\n",
      "your core groans softly within you as you recall the delicious aroma, whispering of tender flesh and sweet, red essence.\n",
      "a green sigil indicates a healthy and plentiful hunting-ground, while red means that the area is almost empty, with yellow between.\n",
      "(part ii) young adulthood in the great green.\n",
      "my lord sleeps upon a shifting bed of purest delver-refined silver shinestone discs, dappled with emeralds like fruit fallen onto a fertile plain.\n",
      "at the last, the great secret revealed itself to the great one, and wielding this secret, the supreme heart of the green-over-the-blue was claimed as territory.\n",
      "on restless nights, your name has been sung out in frustration across the rain-blessed green, and all goodbeasts tremble to hear it spoken with such rage, such desire.\n",
      "opinions in the green are greatly divided on the matter.\n",
      "but as bloom's legend grows far across the blue, you sometimes find yourself sniffing one of its feathers left behind for unclear reasons, and remembering.\n",
      "how many great blues do they swim in?\n",
      "offer the crystal fang offer the bloodstone offer the shakestick offer the obstinate stone offer the lodestone offer the refining stone offer the false face offer the sleeping stone offer the crystal flower offer the silver rod offer the onyx rod offer the perpetual pyramid offer the bezoar offer the heavy cube offer the giant pearl offer the living labyrinth offer the elixir offer the curios offer the gold choker offer the @#$% offer the pain-killer brace offer the nightjaw offer the darkspine offer the awakened silver rod offer the awakened onyx rod offer the icosidodecahedron offer the hunting headbone offer no artifacts to rift such treasure, and yet so callow.\n",
      "since being thwarted here, the illuminated one has risen to fame and power in a far-distant land, across the great blue.\n",
      "surely, all kin wish for servants as loyal and brave as this one, which has crossed the great blue in its search for you.\n",
      "no kin has ever tasted the flesh of such a featherbeast on this side of the blue, however.\n",
      "even now, it slumbers upon a mountain of silver, festooned with amethyst and emeralds.\n",
      "it is said that this is the heart of the great green, and indeed, i sense the spirit's presence here... but the great green has many hearts, and of them all, my homeland is the greatest, most powerful and fragile in its intricacies.\n",
      "indeed, in this coldward land, most of the creatures seem to be brown.\n",
      "already i miss the vivid reds, yellows and blues of the goodbeasts of home.\n",
      "it was made out of a crystallized sun-beam and given to my people by the spirit of the green after we lost our short beaks in a battle with a demon.\n",
      "bard proceeds to cough up a very large and beautiful emerald cut into thirty-five facets.\n",
      "all corners of earth's broad body have i beheld, from her red-robed depths to her iceclad heights.\n",
      "in the dreaming, i inhabit a blue-crystal lair like unto many mountains melted together.\n",
      "one who inhabits the very heart of the green, at so tender an age... who is like unto you?\n",
      "disquieted by your earlier success, the ruby kin has flooded this antechamber with earth's deadly essence.\n",
